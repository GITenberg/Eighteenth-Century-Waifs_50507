<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>It was probably Solomon, who, in Ecclesiastes,
cap. 12, v. 12, said, ‘Of making many books
there is no end.’ But, if this book had to have
been written by him, he might, probably, have
modified his opinion.</p>

<p>I have read some books in my life-time, <i>re</i>
the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries,
and therefore was not taken aback when
I was advised by a learned friend, whom I consulted
as to the subject of a new book, to try
the ‘Musgrave Tracts,’ in the British Museum.
I thanked him, and wrote for them, when I was
politely asked, ‘Did I want them all?’ ‘Of
course,’ was my reply; when I was told, with
the courtesy that particularly distinguishes the
establishment, that I had better come into an
inner room, and have them down shelf by shelf.</p>

<p>The books came in a continuous stream, until
I asked if there were any more. ‘Oh, yes,’ was
the reply; and, when I had finished my job, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
found I had gone through more than 1760 volumes.
Add to this over 200 other books and
newspapers used for reference, &amp;c., and that will
represent some amount of the labour employed
in writing a book.</p>

<p>I have strung together a series of chapters
of different phases of social life and biography
of the last century, none of which have (as far
as I am concerned) appeared in any magazine,
but which have all been specially written for
this book. And this I have done so that the
book may be taken up at any time, and laid
down again at the end of an article; and perhaps
the best reason for my publishing this
book is, that it gives the reader a brief <i>resum&eacute;</i>
of each subject treated, taken from sources,
thoroughly original, which are usually inaccessible
to the general public, and known but
to few students.</p>

<p>They are diverse, to suit all tastes; and if
this, my venture, is successful, I may bashfully
hint that my store is not yet exhausted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> of the most curious phases of religious
mania is that where the patient is under
the impression that he is divinely inspired,
and has a special mission to his fellow-men,
which he is impelled to fulfil at
all costs and under all circumstances.</p>

<p>From the earliest ages of Christianity <i>pseudo-Christoi</i>,
or false Christs, existed. Simon Magus, Dositheus,
and the famous Barcochab were among the first of
them, and they were followed by Moses, in Crete,
in the fifth century; Julian, in Palestine, <i>circa</i> <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
530; and Serenus, in Spain, <i>circa</i> <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 714. There
were, in the twelfth century, some seven or eight
in France, Spain, and Persia; and, coming to more
modern times, there was Sabbatai Zewi, a native of
Aleppo, or Smyrna, who proclaimed himself to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
the Messiah, in Jerusalem, <i>circa</i> 1666. The list of
religious fanatics is a long one. Mahomet, Munzer,
John of Leyden, Brothers, Matthews, Joanna Southcott,
‘Courtenay,’ or Thomas, and Joe Smith are
among them, and are well-known; but there are
hundreds of others whose work has not been on so
grand a scale, or whose influence has not been of
the national importance of the above; and it is of
one of these forgotten fanatics that I now treat.</p>

<p>Well out in the Atlantic Ocean, far west, indeed,
even of the Western Isles, stands the lonely island
of St. Kilda, or Hirta, as it used to be called, from
<i>h-Iar-tir</i>, the Gaelic for West land, or West country.
Its rocky sides are inaccessible, except at one landing-place,
at a bay on the south-east, and it is the home
and breeding-place of millions of sea-birds, whose
flesh and eggs form the main supply of food for the
inhabitants, and whose feathers, together with a
few sheep and cattle, and what little barley can be
grown, or butter can be made, pay the trifling rent
required, and help to provide the bare necessaries of
civilized existence.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are not healthy, so many dying, as
young children, of a disease locally known as the ‘eight
day sickness,’ a disease which generally attacks them
on the eighth or ninth day after birth, and mostly
proves fatal in the course of a day or two. From
this and other causes, including falls from cliffs, the
population has remained nearly stationary, as is evidenced
by the fact that for the last hundred years
the inhabitants have averaged under a hundred.
Indeed, at one time, in 1724, small-pox attacked
the islanders, being imported by one of them on his
return from a visit to Harris, and all the adults died
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
except four, who were left to take care of twenty-six
orphans, all that were left of twenty-four families.</p>

<p>Lying out of the ordinary track of boats, even of
yachts, it is, even now, seldom visited, and in the
last century no one except the steward of Macleod
(whose family have been the possessors of St. Kilda
for hundreds of years), who made an annual pilgrimage
to collect the rent, ever came near the
place. Its loneliness was proverbial, so much so
that it was an article of faith that the arrival of
strangers brought with them a kind of influenza
called boat-cough, which was sometimes fatal. This
singular disease does not seem to be confined to St.
Kilda, for Bates, in ‘The Naturalist on the River
Amazon,’ mentions certain tribes near Ega who are
gradually becoming extinct from a slow fever and
cold, which attacks them after they have been
visited by civilised people. And in the ‘Cruise of
H.M.S. Galatea,’ in 1867-68, it says, ‘Tristran d’Acunha
is a remarkably healthy island; but it is a singular
fact that any vessel touching there from St. Helena
invariably brings with it a disease resembling
influenza.’</p>

<p>This belief is amusingly illustrated in Boswell’s
‘Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides.’ ‘This evening
he (Dr. Johnson) disputed the truth of what is said
as to the people of St. Kilda catching cold whenever
strangers come. “How can there,” said he,
“be a physical effect without a physical cause?”
He added, laughing, “The arrival of a ship full of
strangers would kill them; for, if one stranger gives
them one cold, two strangers must give them two
colds, and so on in proportion.” I wondered to hear
him ridicule this, as he had praised McAulay for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
putting it in his book,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> saying that it was manly in
him to tell a fact, however strange, if he himself
believed it. They said it was annually proved by
Macleod’s steward, on whose arrival all the inhabitants
caught cold. He jocularly remarked, “The
steward always comes to demand something from
them, and so they fall a-coughing. I suppose the
people in Skye all take a cold when&mdash;&mdash;” (naming
a certain person) “comes.” They said he only came
in summer. <i>Johnson</i>&mdash;“That is out of tenderness to
you. Bad weather and he at the same time would
be too much.”’</p>

<p>The first printed account of this poor lonely island
is, probably, in a little book by Donald Monro, High
Dean of the Isles,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> 1594. He there says, ‘The inhabitants
therof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit
in aney religion, but McCloyd of Herray,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> his stewart,
or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in
the zeir ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to
baptize bairns ther, and if they want<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> a chaplaine,
they baptize their bairns themselfes.’</p>

<p>At the end of the seventeenth century, when Roderick,
the religious impostor, or fanatic, lived, things
spiritual were somewhat improved, although they only
had the annual clerical visit. There were three
chapels on the island, to serve a population of one
hundred and eighty. One was called Christ’s Chapel,
hardly discernible from one of their dwellings, being
built and thatched in a similar manner; but it contained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
one of their chief treasures, a brass crucifix,
which lay upon an altar therein. They paid no
adoration or worship to this, but it was their most
precious possession, being used, as are the gospels
elsewhere, for the purpose of solemn asseveration,
and it was also made use of at marriages and the
healing of strife.</p>

<p>The people observed as Holy-days Christmas,
Easter, Good Friday, St. Columba’s Day, and All
Saints. They ceased all work at midnight on Saturday,
and kept the Sabbath, in this respect, very
strictly, only resuming their ordinary avocations on
Monday morning. They believed in the Trinity, and
in a future state of happiness and misery, and that
God ordains all things. They took great care with
their churchyard, which they fenced round with
stone, so that no cattle should desecrate God’s Acre,
and they had a peculiar belief in the embodiment of
spirits, and fancied that they could, at will, incorporate
themselves with the rocks, hills, etc.</p>

<p>Of the three chapels, one only seems to have been
used, and this, not being large enough to accommodate
the islanders, the whole of the inhabitants would
assemble, on every Sunday morning, in the churchyard,
and there devoutly say the Lord’s Prayer,
the Creed, and the Ten Commandments. This form
of worship was simple enough; but it seems to
have been of recent introduction&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, about the
beginning of the seventeenth century; when, somehow
or other, there was a man upon the island who
passed for a Roman Catholic priest, but who was so
ignorant that he did not know the Lord’s Prayer,
the Creed, or the Decalogue correctly; and, consequently,
he taught the poor people an incorrect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
version, but to him they owed the crucifix, and the
observance of the Holy-days before mentioned, and
with this teacher they were content until the year
1641, when one Coll McDonald, or Ketoch, fled from
Ireland, and, with a few men, landed at St. Kilda,
where he lived in amity with the inhabitants for
nearly a year. He rebuked the so-called priest for
his ignorance, and he taught the poor simple folk
the correct version of the text of their very primitive
worship&mdash;in fine, he was considered so far superior
to the priest, that the natives would fain have
deposed the latter; but this McDonald would not
suffer.</p>

<p>Martin Martin,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> writing in 1698, describes the happy
condition of the islanders at that date. ‘The Inhabitants
of St. Kilda are much happier than the
generality of Mankind, as being almost the only
People in the World who feel the sweetness of true
Liberty: What the Condition of the People in the
Golden Age is feign’d by the Poets to be, that theirs
really is; I mean, in Innocency and Simplicity, Purity,
Mutual Love, and Cordial Friendship, free from solicitous
Cares and anxious Covetousness; from Envy, Deceit,
and Dissimulation; from Ambition and Pride, and the
Consequences that attend them. They are altogether
ignorant of the Vices of Foreigners, and governed by
the Dictates of Reason and Christianity, as it was
first delivered to them by those Heroick Souls whose
Zeal moved them to undergo danger and trouble, to
plant Religion here in one of the remotest Corners
of the World.’</p>

<p>This Eden, however, was doomed to have its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Serpent, and these simple folk were fated to be led
into error by a man who seems to have been physically
above the average of the islanders, for he is
described as ‘a Comely, well-proportioned fellow,
Red-hair’d, and exceeding all the Inhabitants of St.
Kilda in Strength, Climbing, &amp;c.’ Naturally he was
illiterate, for the means of culture were altogether
lacking in that lonely isle; but he was above his
fellows, inasmuch as he was a poet, and, moreover,
he claimed to have the gift of ‘second sight,’ a pretension
which would naturally cause him to be looked
up to by these Gaelic islanders. These qualifications
which Roderick (for such was his name) claimed,
naturally pointed to his becoming a leader of some
sort; and he seems to have entered upon his vocation
early in life, for, when we first hear of him in his
public capacity, he was but eighteen years of age.</p>

<p>We have read how strictly the islands kept the
Sabbath, and Roderick seems to have been the first to
break through their customs&mdash;by going fishing on
that day. As, according to all moral ethics, something
dreadful will surely overtake the Sabbath
breaker, it is comforting to know that Roderick formed
no exception to the rule. One Sunday he committed
the heinous and, hitherto, unknown sin of fishing&mdash;and,
on his return, he declared that, as he was
coming home, a ‘Man, dressed in a Cloak and Hat,’
suddenly appeared in the road before him. Needless
to say, this apparition frightened him, and he fell
upon his face before the supernatural being, but the
Man desired him not to be afraid, for he was John
the Baptist, who had come specially from Heaven, the
bearer of good tidings to the inhabitants of St. Kilda,
and with a divine commission to instruct Roderick in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
religious matters, which instruction he was to impart
to his neighbours for their spiritual welfare.</p>

<p>Roderick diffidently objected to thus being made a
medium, and alleged his incapacity to receive such
revelations and act upon them; but the pseudo-saint
cheered him, and bade him be of good courage,
declaring that he would immediately make him fit
for his predestined purpose, and, according to the
poor fanatic’s account, gave him the following instructions:</p>

<p>It was to be of primary importance, and as a visible
sign of their belief, that his followers should observe
Friday as a strict fast&mdash;so strict, indeed, that not a
particle of food of any description must pass their
lips on that day, nor might they even indulge in a
pinch of snuff&mdash;a small luxury which they dearly
loved. He next promulgated the comforting assurance
that many of the deceased islanders were Saints
in Heaven, and there interceded for those living;
that everyone had his own particular advocate, and,
on the anniversary of the day peculiar to each Saint,
his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> on earth was to make a feast to his neighbours
of the very best of his substance, such as
mutton, fowls, &amp;c., Roderick, of course, to be the
chief and honoured guest on the occasion.</p>

<p>A sheep was to be sacrificed on the threshold of
each house by every family (presumably only once
a year), and this was to be done in a specially cruel
manner, for no knife was to touch it, but its throat
was to be hacked with the crooked spades they used
in husbandry, whose edges were about half-an-inch
thick. This was to be done at night, but no one
might partake of the mutton that night under penalty
of similarly slaughtering a sheep the next day for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
every person that had eaten of it. It is difficult to see
what was his object in these ordinances&mdash;except to
make sure of good living at the expense of his poor
dupes, who, if they turned refractory, and disobeyed
his injunctions, were threatened with the most awful
Judgment to come.</p>

<p>That he was keen enough in his own interests is
exemplified in one of his promulgations. He picked
out a bush upon a rising ground, which he christened
‘John the Baptist’s Bush,’ for there, he declared, the
Saint had appeared to him; and this he ordered
should be holy ground, which must never be defiled
by the tread of sheep or cattle. He also built a wall&mdash;certainly
not a high one&mdash;round it: and should, by
chance, any unhappy sheep, in the lightsomeness of
its heart, or succumbing to the temptation of the
herbage, overleap this wall, and dare to browse upon
the sacred soil, it was staightway to be slain&mdash;and
Roderick and its owner were to eat its carcase. But,
as the Saint evidently foresaw that some stiff-necked,
and not properly-converted proselyte, might object
to this disposition of his personal property and might
refuse to have the sheep slaughtered, he commanded
that such a recusant should be <span class="smcap">Anathema</span>, cast out,
and excluded from all fellowship, until such time as
he saw the error of his ways, recanted, and expiated
his sin by permitting the sacrifice.</p>

<p>For discipline must be maintained in a religious
body, as well as in a purely secular society; and
Roderick had no intention of having his authority
disputed. For minor offences he had a cheerful penance.
No matter what was the weather, the sinner
must strip, and forthwith walk or jump into the
water, there to stand until the divinely-inspired one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
chose to release him, and, if more than one were thus
punished at the same time, they were to beguile the
moments, and somewhat increase their penance, by
pouring cold water upon each other’s heads.</p>

<p>He was for no half-measures. This new Divine
revelation must thoroughly supersede and root out
the old superstitions; so he forbade the use of the
Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments&mdash;the
whole formulary of the islanders’ simple
faith&mdash;and substituted forms of his own. His prayers
are described as rhapsodical productions, in which, in
spite of the abolition of the old form of worship, he
introduced the names of God, our Saviour, and the
immaculate Virgin, together with words unintelligible
either to himself or his hearers, but which he declared
to have received direct from the Baptist, and delivered
to his hearers, as in duty bound.</p>

<p>He kept up his connection with St. John, and used
to assert that every night, when the people were
assembled, he heard a voice, saying, ‘Come you out,
and then he lost all control over himself, and was
constrained to go. Then would the Baptist meet
him, and instruct him in what he was to say to the
people. St. John evidently expected his disciple to
exercise all his intelligence, for he would only say his
message once, and never could be got to repeat it.
On one occasion, Roderick could not understand it,
or hardly remember a sentence; so he naturally inquired
of the Saint how he was to behave. He got
no comfort, however, only a brusque, ‘Go, you have
it,’ with which he was fain to be content, and, wonderful
to relate, on his return to his flock, he remembered
every word he had been told, and could retail
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
it fluently&mdash;but, as a rule, his discourses were discursive,
and apt to send his auditors to sleep.</p>

<p>Naturally the women flocked to him, and he took
them specially (some said too specially) under his
protection. To them he revealed that, if they followed
him faithfully, eternal bliss should be their
portion, and that they should go to heaven in glorious
state, riding upon milk-white steeds. For them he
exercised his poetic talents (for he composed long,
rhapsodical rhymes, which he called psalms, and which
were sung by his flock), and he taught them a devout
hymn, called the ‘Virgin Mary’s,’ which he declared
she had sent specially to them, and that it was of
such wonderful efficacy, that whoever could repeat it
by heart would not die in child-bearing; but, of course,
so valuable a gift could not be imparted gratis, so
every scholar was mulcted in a sheep before she was
instructed in the potent hymn.</p>

<p>Yet, as with many another, a woman was the
primary cause of his downfall. It was his behaviour
to a woman that first opened the eyes of his deluded
followers, and showed them that their idol was fallible,
and that his feet were ‘part of iron, and part of clay.’
The wife of Macleod’s representative found favour in
his sight; but, being a virtuous woman, she told her
husband of the Prophet’s wicked advances; and these
two laid a little trap, into which the unsuspecting,
but naughty, Roderick walked.</p>

<p>It was very simple: the husband hid himself until
he judged proper to appear&mdash;confronted the guilty
man&mdash;spoke burning words of reproof to him&mdash;thoroughly
disorganised him, and brought him very
low&mdash;made him beg his pardon, and promise he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
never so sin again. But although a hollow peace
was patched up between them, and the injured husband
even gave the greatest sign of friendship possible,
according to their notions (<i>i.e.</i>, taking Roderick’s
place as sponsor at the baptism of one of his own
children), yet the story leaked out. The Prophet’s
father plainly and openly told him he was a deceiver,
and would come to a bad end; and the thinking
portion of the community began to have serious
doubts of the Divine origin of his mission.</p>

<p>These doubts were further confirmed by one or
two little facts which led the people to somewhat
distrust his infallibility, especially in one case in
which his cousin-german Lewis was concerned. This
man had an ewe which had brought forth three
lambs at one time, and these wicked sheep actually
browsed upon the sacred bush! Of course we know
the Baptist had decreed their slaughter, and Lewis
was promptly reminded of the fact&mdash;but he did not
see it in that light. His heart was hard, and his
sheep were dear to him. He argued that, from his
point of view, it was unreasonable to kill so many
animals, and inflict such serious damage to their
proprietor, for so trivial a fault&mdash;and, besides, he
would not. Of course there was nothing to be done
with such an hardened sinner but to carry out the
law, and excommunicate him; which was accordingly
done&mdash;with the usual result. The poor simple
folk, in their faith, looked for a speedy and awful
judgment to fall upon Lewis and his sheep.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘But what gave rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To no little surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nobody seem’d one penny the worse!’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And then they bethought them that, if it were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
their own case, they might as well treat the matter
as Lewis had done&mdash;seeing he was none the worse,
and four sheep to the good; and so his authority
over them gradually grew laxer and laxer: and,
when the steward paid his annual visit in 1697, they
denounced Roderick as an impostor, and expressed
contrition for their own back-slidings.</p>

<p>The chaplain who accompanied the steward, and
who was sent over from Harris by Macleod, purposely
to look into this matter, made the Prophet publicly
proclaim himself an impostor, compelled him to
commence with his own hands the destruction of
the enclosure round the sacred bush, and scatter the
stones broadcast&mdash;and, finally, the steward, whose
word was absolute law to these poor people, took
him away, never to return. The poor credulous
dupes, on being reproved for so easily complying to
this impostor, with one voice answered that what
they did was unaccountable; but, seeing one of
their own number and stamp in all respects endued,
as they fancied, with a powerful faculty of preaching
so fluently and frequently, and pretending to converse
with John the Baptist, they were induced to
believe in his mission from Heaven, and therefore
complied with his commands without dispute.</p>

<p>Of his ultimate fate nothing is known, the last
record of him being that, after having been taken
to Harris, he was brought before the awful Macleod,
to be judged, ‘who, being informed of this Fellow’s
Impostures, did forbid him from that time forward to
Preach any more on pain of Death. This was a
great mortification, as well as disappointment, to the
Impostor, who was possessed with a fancy that
<i>Mack-Leod</i> would hear him preach, and expected no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
less than to persuade him to become one of his
Proselytes, as he has since confessed.’ He was sent
to Skye, where he made public recantation of his
errors, and confessed in several churches that it was
the Devil, and not St. John, with whom he conversed&mdash;and,
arguing from that fact, he probably was
docile, and lived the remainder of his life in Skye&mdash;a
harmless lunatic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In October, 1885, public attention was particularly
directed to St. Kilda, and the story cannot be better told than
by reproducing some contemporary newspaper paragraphs.</p>

<p><i>Morning Post</i>, October 9, 1885.&mdash;‘A letter has been
received by Principal Rainy, Edinburgh, and has been
forwarded to the Home Secretary from St. Kilda. The
letter was found on the shore of Harris, having been
floated from St. Kilda in a little boat made of a piece of
plank. The letter was written by the clergyman of St.
Kilda, by direction of the islanders, asking that the Government
should be informed that their corn, barley, and potatoes
were destroyed by a great storm, in the hope that Government
would send a supply of corn-seed, barley, and potatoes,
as the crop was quite useless.’</p>

<p><i>Ibid</i>, October 21, 1885.&mdash;‘The steamer from Glasgow,
carrying supplies to the starving people of St. Kilda,
reached the island on Monday, and safely landed the stores.
The islanders were in good health, but their crops have
been swept away, and, but for the supplies sent by the
steamer, they would have been in very perilous straits for
food. Intelligence of the distress of St. Kilda was first
made known by bottles thrown into the sea.’</p>

<p><i>Times</i>, April 8, 1886.&mdash;‘A Parliamentary paper has been
issued containing a report of Mr. Malcolm McNeill, inspecting
officer of the Board of Supervision, on the alleged destitution
in the island of St. Kilda, in October, 1885, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
supplementary reports by Lieutenant Osborne, R.N., commanding
officer, and by the medical officer of H.M.S.
<i>Jackal</i>. The report shows that, news from St. Kilda having
reached Harris by means of letters enclosed in a small boat
a yard long, found on the shore, to the effect that the corn,
barley, and potatoes of the inhabitants had been destroyed
by a great storm that had passed over the island early in
September, and that, in consequence, the crofters of St.
Kilda were suffering great privations, a steamer, the
<i>Hebridean</i>, was despatched from Glasgow to the island with
stores on the 13th of October, and, by arrangement with
the Admiralty, H.M.S. <i>Jackal</i>, conveying Mr. McNeill,
left Rothesay Bay for St. Kilda on Wednesday, October 21,
1885. Mr. McNeill reported that, so far from being destitute,
the inhabitants of the island were amply, indeed
luxuriously, supplied with food, and in possession of sums of
money said to average not less than &pound;20 a family. Dr.
Acheson, of H.M.S. <i>Jackal</i>, reported that the inhabitants of
St. Kilda were well-clad and well-fed, being much better
off in these respects than the peasants in many other parts
of Great Britain.’</p>

<p>Another newspaper paragraph not only confirms this,
but adds to our knowledge of the island and its inhabitants.
‘Mr. Malcolm McNeill ... reported on the 24th of October
that the population of St. Kilda&mdash;seventy-seven souls in
all&mdash;were amply, “indeed, luxuriously,” supplied with food
for the winter. The supplies included sheep, fulmar, solan
geese, meal, potatoes, milk, fish, tea, and sugar; and a large
sum of money, said to average not less than &pound;20 a family,
was known to be hoarded in the island&mdash;a large profit
being derived from tourists. Mr. McNeill states that a
former emigrant, who returned from Australia for a few
months in 1884, spread discontent among the people, who
now showed a strong desire to emigrate, and in this he
suggested that the Government should assist them. Dr.
Acheson of the <i>Jackal</i>, reporting on visits paid both then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
and in 1884, notes that the people seemed to be better clad
and fed than the peasants of many other parts of Great
Britain. He was struck by the comparatively large number
of infirm persons&mdash;by the large number of women compared
with men, and by the comparatively small number of
children. The food was abundant, but lacked variety;
was rather indigestible, and was nearly devoid of vegetables
for six months each year. He saw no signs of vinegar,
pepper, mustard, pickles, or other condiments, but there was
a great liking for tobacco and spirits. The diet he pronounces
quite unfit for children, aged persons, or invalids;
and, to remedy this, he suggests that an endeavour should
be made to grow cabbages, turnips, carrots, and other
vegetables on the island; that fowls should be introduced,
and that pressed vegetables and lime juice might be issued
when no fresh vegetables are procurable. Judging from
the amount of clothing worn, the doctor thinks the people
are more likely to suffer from excess than from the other extreme,
for, on September 14th, 1884, with the thermometer
sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, he found a
healthy adult male wearing “a thick tweed waistcoat, with
flannel back and sleeves, two thick flannel undervests, tweed
trousers, a flannel shirt, flannel drawers, boots, and stockings,
Tam o’ Shanter cap, and a thick, scarlet worsted
muffler around his neck.” The furniture he found scanty,
and very rough, and the houses very dirty. St. Kilda is not
a desirable retreat, for Dr. Acheson reports that at present
there are no games nor music in the island, and&mdash;strangest
fact of all in this official document&mdash;“whistling is strictly
forbidden.”’

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/t.jpg" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is a little poem by Dean Swift,
published by him in Dublin, in 1728,
and reprinted in London, in 1729. Its
price was only fourpence, and it is
called, ‘The Journal of a Modern Lady,
in a Letter to a Person of Quality.’ It is so small,
that it is absolutely lost in the Dean’s voluminous
works, yet it is very amusing, and, as far as I can
judge (having made an especial study of the Social
Life of the Eighteenth Century), it is not at all
exaggerated; and for this reason I have ventured
to reproduce it. It is borne out in similar descriptions
both in the early and latter portions of the
century; as, for instance, in ‘The English Lady’s
Catechism,’ 1703, of which the following is a portion:</p>

<h3>HOW DO YOU EMPLOY YOUR TIME NOW?</h3>

<p>‘I lie in Bed till Noon, dress all the Afternoon,
Dine in the Evening, and Play at Cards till Midnight.’</p>

<p>‘How do you spend the Sabbath?’</p>

<p>‘In Chit-Chat.’</p>

<p>‘What do you talk of?’</p>

<p>‘New Fashions and New Plays.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>
<p>‘How often do you go to Church?’
</p>

<p>‘Twice a year or oftener, according as my Husband
gives me new Cloaths.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you go to Church when you have new
Cloaths?’</p>

<p>‘To see other People’s Finery, and to show my
own, and to laugh at those scurvy, out-of-fashion
Creatures that come there for Devotion.’</p>

<p>‘Pray, Madam, what Books do you read?’</p>

<p>‘I read lewd Plays and winning Romances.’</p>

<p>‘Who is it you love?’</p>

<p>‘Myself.’</p>

<p>‘What! nobody else?’</p>

<p>‘My Page, my Monkey, and my Lap Dog.’</p>

<p>‘Why do you love them?’</p>

<p>‘Why, because I am an English lady, and they
are Foreign Creatures: my Page from Genoa, my
Monkey from the East Indies, and my Lap Dog from
Vigo.’</p>

<p>‘Would they not have pleased you as well if they
had been English?’</p>

<p>‘No, for I hate everything that Old England brings
forth, except it be the temper of an English Husband,
and the liberty of an English Wife. I love the French
Bread, French Wines, French Sauces, and a French
Cook; in short, I have all about me French or Foreign,
from my Waiting Woman to my Parrot.’</p>

<p>‘How do you pay your debts?’</p>

<p>‘Some with money, and some with fair promises.
I seldom pay anybody’s bills, but run more into their
debt. I give poor Tradesmen ill words, and the rich
I treat civilly, in hopes to get further in their debt.’</p>

<p>Addison, in the <i>Spectator</i> (No. 323, March 11th,
1712), gives Clarinda’s Journal for a week, from
which I will only extract one day as a sample.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Wednesday.</span> <i>From Eight to Ten.</i> Drank two
Dishes of Chocolate in Bed, and fell asleep after ’em.</p>

<p>‘<i>From Ten to Eleven.</i> Eat a Slice of Bread and
Butter, drank a Dish of Bohea, read the <i>Spectator</i>.</p>

<p>‘<i>From Eleven to One.</i> At my Toilet, try’d a new
Head.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Gave orders for <i>Veney</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> to be combed and

<p>‘<i>From One till Half an Hour after Two.</i> Drove to
the Change. Cheapened a couple of Fans.</p>

<p>‘<i>Till Four.</i> At Dinner. <i>Mem.</i> Mr. Frost passed
by in his new Liveries.</p>

<p>‘<i>From Four to Six.</i> Dressed, paid a visit to old
Lady Blithe and her Sister, having heard they were
gone out of Town that Day.</p>

<p>‘<i>From Six to Eleven.</i> At Basset.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> <i>Mem.</i> Never

<p>Gambling was one of the curses of the Eighteenth
Century. From Royalty downwards, all played
Cards&mdash;the men, perhaps, preferred dice, and ‘Casting
a Main’&mdash;but the women were inveterate card-players,
until, in the latter part of the century, it
became a national scandal, owing to the number of
ladies who, from their social position, should have
acted better, who kept Faro-tables, and to whom
the nickname of <i>Faro’s Daughters</i> was applied. There
were Ladies Buckinghamshire and Archer, Mrs. Concannon,
Mrs. Hobart, Mrs. Sturt, and others, whose
houses were neither more nor less than gaming-houses.
The evil was so great, that Lord Kenyon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
in delivering judgment in a trial to recover &pound;15
won at card-playing, said that the higher classes set
a bad example in this matter to the lower, and, he
added, ‘They think they are too great for the law;
I wish they could be punished. If any prosecutions
of this kind are fairly brought before me, and the
parties are justly convicted, whatever be their rank
or station in the country&mdash;though they be the first
ladies in the land&mdash;they shall certainly exhibit themselves
in the pillory.’</p>

<p>The caricaturists got hold of his Lordship’s speech,
and depicted Lady Archer and others in the pillory,
and Lady Buckinghamshire being whipped at a
cart’s-tail by Lord Kenyon. With the century this
kind of play died out; but some mention of it was
necessary in order to show that Swift’s description
of ladies gambling was not exaggerated.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is much and curious food for reflection,
in the tendency that mankind
has ever shown to sympathise with the
daring and ingenious depredators who
relieve the rich of their superfluity,
which may possibly be owing to the romantic adventures
and hair-breadth escapes which the robbers, in
their career, have undergone. But, be the cause what
it may, it is certain that the populace of all nations
view with admiration great and successful thieves:
for instance, what greater popular hero, and one that
has been popular for centuries, could be found than
Robin Hood?</p>

<p>Almost every country in Europe has its traditional
thief, whose exploits are recorded both in prose and
poetry. In England, Claude Duval, Captain Hind,
Dick Turpin, Jonathan Wild, and Jack Sheppard
have each in their turn occupied a prominent place
in the annals of crime; whilst in France, amongst the
light-fingered heroes that have, from time to time,
extorted respect from the multitude, Cartouche and
Vidocq take first rank. Germany is proud of its
Schinderhannes, the Robber of the Rhine, the stories
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
of whose generosity and courage still render his
memory a favourite on the banks of that river, the
travellers on which he so long kept in awe. In Italy
and Spain, those homes of brigands and banditti, the
inhabitants have ever-ready sympathy for the men
whose names and exploits are as familiar among them
as ‘household words.’</p>

<p>Cartouche, however, is the only rival to Barrington
in their particular line, and Barrington, certainly, was
no mere common pick-pocket, only fit to figure in
the ‘Newgate Calendar,’ but he possessed talents which,
had they been properly directed on his first setting
out in life, might have enabled him to have played a
distinguished part either in literature or in business.
But, unfortunately, very early in his youth, poverty
led him to adopt theft as his professed vocation;
and, by his ingenuity and constant practice, he contrived
to render himself so expert, as almost to have
conducted his depredations on systematic rules, and
elevated his crime into a ‘high art.’ Barrington,
too, by his winning manners, gentlemanly address,
and the fair education he contrived to pick up, was a
man eminently fitted (if such an expression may be
allowed) for his profession! his personal appearance
was almost sufficient to disarm suspicion, and this, in
all probability, contributed greatly to the success
which he met with in his career.</p>

<p>George Barrington, or Waldron (for it is not
known which was his right name), was born on the
14th of May, 1755, at the village of Maynooth, county
Kildare, in Ireland, now famous for the Royal College
of St. Patrick, which is there situated. His reputed
father was Henry Waldron, who was a working
silversmith, and his mother, whose maiden name was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Naish, was a dressmaker, or mantua-maker, as it was
then called (also occasionally acting as midwife), in
the same village; but, whether they had ever been
legally united, is a matter open to doubt.</p>

<p>To have their parentage disputed is a fate which
the great ones of the earth have frequently to
undergo, and George Barrington, or Waldron, is an
instance of this, for more than one of his historians
assert that he was the son of a Captain Barrington,
an officer in a marching regiment quartered at Rush,
and the date of his birth is given as 1758; but the
most trustworthy evidence places it on record as
above stated.</p>

<p>His parents’ characters stood high among their
neighbours for integrity and industry, but they were,
unfortunately, always behindhand with the world,
and never able to extricate themselves from the state
of abject poverty in which they were sunk, in consequence
of unsuccessful litigation with a wealthy
relation. This want of means prevented them from
giving George any education until he was seven
years of age, when he was sent to the village school,
and there was taught to read and write. A benevolent
surgeon in the neighbourhood afterwards instructed
him in arithmetic, geography, and grammar;
but, if the anecdote related of him is true, he repaid
the kindness by the blackest ingratitude in stealing
some coins from his benefactor’s daughter.</p>

<p>Young Waldron was lucky enough to attract the
notice of the Rev. Dr. Westropp, a dignitary of the
Church of Ireland, who placed him, when he was
sixteen years of age, at a grammar-school in Dublin,
and this patron proposed that he should fit himself
for the university. But fate had decreed otherwise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
and he enjoyed the benefits of this gentleman’s
kindness but a short time, for, in a moment of passion,
when quarrelling with another boy, he stabbed his
antagonist with a pen-knife, wounding him severely.
Instead of making the matter one for legal investigation,
the boy received a thorough good flogging,
a degradation he could by no means forgive, and he
resolved to run away from school, and leave family,
friends, and all his fair prospects behind him. But,
previous to carrying his plan of escape into action,
he found means to appropriate ten or twelve guineas
belonging to the master of the school, and a gold
repeating-watch, which was the property of his
master’s sister. Not content with this booty, he
took a few shirts and pairs of stockings, and safely
effected his retreat, one still night in 1771, starting
off for Drogheda.</p>

<p>There happened to be staying at the obscure inn
at which he put up, on his arrival at Drogheda, a
set of strolling players, whose manager was one
John Price, who had once been a lawyer’s clerk, and
had been convicted of some fraud at the Old Bailey.
He soon wormed the boy’s whole story out of him,
and persuaded him to join the theatrical company,
which he did, and he applied himself to study so
diligently that he was cast for the part, and played,
four days after his enrolment, Jaffier in Otway’s
tragedy of ‘Venice Preserved,’ in a barn in the
suburbs of Drogheda. Both he and Price were of
opinion that it would be dangerous for him to remain
so near the scene of his late depredations, but were
unable to move for want of money. To overcome
this difficulty, Waldron, who had assumed the name
of Barrington, gave Price the gold repeater he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
stolen, which was sold for the benefit of the company,
and they set out for Londonderry.</p>

<p>But it was found that the expenses of travelling
for so numerous a body, with their <i>impedimenta</i>, were
too great to be balanced by the receipts of rural
audiences, and, on their arrival at Londonderry, their
finances were found to be at a very low ebb indeed.
Under these circumstances, Price insinuated that
Barrington, with his good address and appearance,
could easily introduce himself to the chief places of
resort in the city, and, by picking pockets, might
refill their empty exchequer. This scheme he at
once put into practice, with such success that, at the
close of the evening, he was the possessor of about
forty guineas in cash, and one hundred and fifty
pounds in Irish bank-notes.</p>

<p>The picking of pockets being a crime almost
unknown in that part of Ireland, the town took the
alarm, and a great stir was made over the matter;
but it being fair-time, and many strangers in the
city, neither Barrington nor Price were suspected;
still they thought it but prudent to leave as soon as
they could with propriety, and, after playing a few
more nights, they moved to Ballyshannon. For
some time he continued this vagabond life, travelling
about the North of Ireland, acting every Tuesday
and Saturday, and picking pockets every day in the
week, a business which he found more lucrative and
entertaining than that of the theatre, where his fame
was by no means equal to the expectation he had
raised.</p>

<p>At Cork, Price and he came to the conclusion
never to think any more of the stage, a resolution
which was the more easily executed, as the company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
to which they originally belonged was now broken
up and dispersed. It was settled between them that
Price should pass for Barrington’s servant, and that
Barrington should act the part of a young gentleman
of large fortune and of noble family, who was not
yet quite of age, travelling for his amusement. They
carried out their scheme well, purchasing horses and
dressing up to their parts, and, during the summer
and autumn of 1772, they visited all the race-courses
in the South of Ireland, making a remarkably successful
campaign. Pocket-picking was a novel experience
to the Irish gentry, and their unsuspicious
ways made them an easy prey to Barrington’s skill
and nimble fingers; so much so that when, at the
setting-in of winter, they returned to Cork, they
found themselves in possession of a large sum of
money (over &pound;1,000), having been fortunate enough
to have escaped detection or even suspicion.</p>

<p>At length their partnership was rudely dissolved,
as, at the close of winter, Price was detected in the
very act of picking a gentleman’s pocket at Cork,
and for this offence he was sentenced to be transported
to America (as was customary then) for seven
years. Barrington immediately converted all his
moveable property into cash, and beat a precipitate
flight to Dublin, where, for a time, he lived a very
private and retired life, only stealing out occasionally
of a dark night to visit some gaming-house, where
he might pick up a few guineas, or a watch, etc., a
mode of life which was by no means congenial to
his ambitious nature, and he again frequented the
race-courses. He met with his first check at Carlow,
where he was detected in picking a nobleman’s
pocket. It was a clear case; the stolen property was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
found on his person, and immediately restored to its
owner, who did not prosecute, preferring to let the
rascal receive the treatment known as ‘the discipline
of the course,’ a punishment very similar to that
meted out to ‘Welchers’ at the present day. But
Ireland was getting too warm for him, and, having
realised his property, he set sail for London, where
he arrived in the summer of 1773, a remarkably
precocious youth of eighteen.</p>

<p>On his voyage across the Channel, he became
acquainted with several persons of respectability,
with one of whom he travelled post to London,
having gulled him with a specious tale about his
family and fortune; and, having gained his confidence,
he procured by his means introductions into
the politest circles, from whom, for a long time, he
extracted abundant plunder. But, in order to do
this, he had to dress well, and live extravagantly,
so that he very soon had to cast about for the means
wherewith to supply his needs. Among the earliest
visits he paid, after his arrival in London, and in
his friend’s company, was, of course, Ranelagh, where
he found two of his acquaintance on the Irish packet
talking to the Duke of Leinster. Bowing to them,
and stationing himself near them, he soon eased the
duke of above eighty pounds, a baronet of five-and-thirty
guineas, and one of the ladies of her watch;
and, with this plunder, he rejoined his party as if
nothing had happened out of the ordinary course
of things.</p>

<p>But his proceedings had been watched by another
member of the thieving fraternity, who was in the
gardens, and who took a speedy opportunity of
letting Barrington know that he had witnessed his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
crime, and threatened to denounce him to the plundered
parties, unless a division of the spoil was made
between them. His manner being very impressive,
left Barrington no alternative but to comply; and
the lady’s watch and chain, with a ten-pound note,
fell to his share. The two supped together, and it
ended with their entering into a mutual alliance,
which, for the time, suited Barrington well, as his
companion knew town much better than he did,
and was especially well-informed in the knowledge
of those places where the plunder could be disposed
of: but this partnership only continued for a short
time, in consequence of their quarrels, there being
nothing in common to bind these two rogues together
save their crime.</p>

<p>In the course of his depredations, he visited Brighton,
or, as it was then called, Brighthelmstone, which was
beginning to be the resort of the wealthier classes,
but, as yet, had not dreamed of the rise it was to
take under George the Magnificent&mdash;and no conception
could have been formed of the present ‘London-on-the-Sea.’
Here, thanks to his pleasant manners
and address, as well as to the company he frequented,
he became acquainted, and intimate, with the Duke
of Ancaster, Lord Ferrers, Lord Lyttleton, and many
other noblemen, who all considered him as a man of
genius and ability (which he certainly was), and were
under the impression that he was a gentleman of
fortune and family.</p>

<p>His manners were good, and he had a pleasant wit&mdash;so
that it is not difficult to imagine that his society
was welcome. As a specimen of his wit, I may relate
an anecdote told of him when on a visit to Chichester
from Brighton. In company of several noblemen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
he was shown the curiosities and notable things in
the town and cathedral. In the latter, their attention
was directed to a family vault for the interment of
the Dukes of Richmond, which had been erected by
the late duke, and which was inscribed ‘Domus
ultima’ (the last house). On this inscription he is
said to have written the following epigram:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Did he, who thus inscribed this wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not <i>read</i>, or not <i>believe</i>, St. Paul?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who says, “There is, where e’er it stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Another</i> house, not made with hands;”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or shall we gather, from the words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <i>House</i> is not a <i>House</i> of Lords.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>After living at the expense of the pockets of his
new-found friends as long as he deemed it prudent,
he returned to London, and began a dissolute and
profligate career; but, though his time was pretty
well employed between his infamous occupation and
his amusements, he yet found opportunity for intervals
of study and literary pursuits, and composed several
odes and poems, which are said to have been not
devoid of merit.</p>

<p>As before stated, he broke with his partner, who
retired to a monastery, where, in all probability, he
ended his days in penitence and peace. But, in the
winter of 1775, Barrington became acquainted with
one Lowe, whom he first employed in the useful
capacity of receiver of stolen goods, and afterwards
went into partnership with. This Lowe was a singular
character. Originally he had been a livery-servant,
and after that he kept a public-house for some
time, when, having saved some money, he turned
usurer or money-lender, in which business he accumulated
a small fortune, when he assumed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
character of a gentleman, and lived in a genteel
house near Bloomsbury Square, then a fashionable
neighbourhood. Here he passed for a very charitable
and benevolent person, and was appointed
treasurer or manager of a new hospital for the
blind in Kentish Town, in which capacity, it is said,
he contrived to become possessed of some five thousand
pounds, when he set fire to the institution.
Being suspected thereof, he was apprehended at
Liverpool, in 1779, when he committed suicide by
taking poison, and was buried at a cross-road, in the
neighbourhood of Prescott in Lancashire.</p>

<p>On forming his partnership with Lowe, it was
resolved on between them that Barrington should
repair to Court on the Queen’s birthday, disguised
as a clergyman, and there endeavour not only to
pick the pockets of the company, but, what was a
far bolder and more novel attempt, to cut off the
diamond stars of the Knights of the Garter, Bath,
or Thistle, who on such days generally wore the
ribands of their respective orders over their coats.
In this enterprise he succeeded beyond the most sanguine
expectations that could have been formed, either
by himself or his partner; for he managed to take
a diamond star from a nobleman, and to get away
from St. James’s unsuspected. But this prize was
too valuable to dispose of in England, and it is said
to have been sold to a Dutch Jew, who came over
from Holland twice a year on purpose to buy stolen
goods, for eight hundred pounds. This haul only
whetted his appetite for yet more profitable plunder,
and a chance of his skill shortly presented itself.</p>

<p>In the course of the winter of 1775, Prince Orloff,
a Russian nobleman of the first rank and consequence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
visited England. The splendour in which he lived,
and the stories of his immense wealth, were frequently
noticed and commented on in the public prints,
and attention was particularly drawn to a gold snuff-box,
set with brilliants, which was one of the many
marks of favour showered upon him by Catherine,
Empress of Russia, and which was generally valued
at the enormous sum of between thirty and forty
thousand pounds. This precious trinket excited Barrington’s
cupidity in an extraordinary degree, and he
determined to exert himself, in order, by some means
or other, to get it into his possession.</p>

<p>A favourable opportunity occurred one night at
Covent Garden Theatre, where he contrived to get
near the prince, and dexterously conveyed the treasure
from his excellency’s waistcoat pocket (in which,
according to Russian custom, it was usually carried)
into his own. This operation was not, however, performed
with sufficient delicacy to escape detection,
for the prince felt the attack that was so impudently
made upon his property, and, having reason to entertain
some suspicion of Barrington, he immediately
seized him by the collar. During the confusion that
naturally ensued upon such an unusual scene, Barrington
slipped the box into the hand of the prince,
who, doubtless, was only too rejoiced to recover it
with so much ease. The thief, however, was secured,
and committed to Tothill Fields Bridewell.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>When examined before Sir John Fielding, Barrington
trumped up a story that he was a native of Ireland,
of an affluent and respectable family; that he
had been educated for the medical profession, and
had come to England to improve himself by means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
of his connections. This story, which was told with
extreme modesty and many tears, induced the prince
to think of him more as an unfortunate gentleman
than a guilty culprit, and he declined to proceed
against him, so that he was dismissed, with an admonition
from Sir John to amend his future conduct;
and he must have left the court congratulating himself
on his narrow, but lucky, escape. The publicity
which was given to this attempt lost him the society
of most of his friends, as he was held up to view in
the disgraceful light of an impostor; and it also was
the means of giving him a further taste of prison
discipline.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of his peculiar industry, he frequented
both Houses of Parliament, where he acquired
considerable plunder. Some weeks after the Covent
Garden affair, he was in the House of Lords during
an interesting debate that attracted a great number
of people, amongst whom was a gentleman who recognised
Barrington, and who informed the Deputy
Usher of the Black Rod of his probable business
there. That official promptly ejected him, though,
perhaps, not with the gentleness that he considered
his due, and he uttered such threats of vengeance
against his accuser that the latter made application
to a magistrate, who granted a warrant to take Barrington
into custody, and to bind him over to keep
the peace. But his credit was now sunk so low that
none of his former companions would come forward
with the necessary sureties, and Barrington, in default,
was relegated to his former place of detention,
Tothill Fields Bridewell, where he remained a considerable
time before he was released.</p>

<p>During his incarceration, the story of his misdeeds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
was industriously circulated, and his character as <i>bon
camarade</i> was completely destroyed, so that the entry
to all decent company was absolutely shut against
him, and from this time forward he was obliged to
abandon the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a ‘gentleman’ pickpocket, and
descend to all the mean artifices of a common pilferer.
Even in this humble branch of his infamous
industry, his good fortune seems to have deserted
him, for he was detected in picking the pocket of a
low woman at Drury Lane Theatre in December,
1776, and, though he made a remarkably clever
speech in his defence, he was sentenced to three
years of ballast-heaving, or hard labour in the hulks
at Woolwich. Here, herded with the vilest of the
vile, he kept as much as possible from them, and, by
his good conduct, attracted the attention of the superintendents
of convicts, and by their intervention he
was set free, after having sustained an imprisonment
of somewhat less than twelve months.</p>

<p>On his liberation, he lost no time in re-commencing
his vicious occupation, under various disguises, sometimes
as a quack doctor, or as a clergyman; or he
would assume the character of a grave commercial
traveller, only to appear, a few days later on, as the
keeper of a gambling-house, and he had many a
narrow escape from capture.</p>

<p>Justice, however, again laid her hands upon him,
for, less than six months after his liberation, he was
detected in picking the pocket of one, Elizabeth
Ironmonger, of a watch, was convicted on the clearest
evidence, and, in spite of the very eloquent and
skilful defence he made, he was a second time sentenced
to the hulks with hard labour, this time for
five years. His speeches to the court, which were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
remarked in the public prints, as well as the letters
that he wrote seeking mitigation of his punishment,
display such talent that it is a matter of great regret
that it was not turned to more honest account. On
one occasion, when tried for stealing Sir G. Webster’s
purse at the opera, in February, 1784, he was able,
by his eloquence, to influence the jury to return a
verdict of not guilty; and a similar piece of good
fortune was vouchsafed to him a year after, when
arraigned for the robbery of a gentleman’s watch at
Drury Lane Theatre, when his most ingenious and
well-chosen address to the jury resulted in his
acquittal.</p>

<p>He could not stand his second imprisonment on
the hulks, and to end it he attempted suicide by
stabbing himself in the breast with a pen-knife.
Medical aid was at hand, and the wound slowly healed,
but he still continued to linger in a miserable
state, until he came under the notice of a gentleman
of position, who used his influence with the government
so successfully that he obtained Barrington’s
release, subject to the condition that he should leave
the country. His benefactor also gave him money
for that purpose, and he was soon on the Chester
coach, <i>en route</i> for Ireland. When he arrived in Dublin,
he found his character had preceded him, and he
was so closely watched that it was not long before
he was again arrested, and acquitted only from want of
evidence. The judge admonished him most seriously,
which gave Barrington an opportunity of airing his
eloquence, and he delivered an oration on the unaccountable
force of prejudice that existed against
him; but, when once he got away, he came to the
conclusion that the Irish capital was not a desirable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
place of residence for him, so he travelled northwards,
and ultimately reached Edinburgh.</p>

<p>However, the police of that city knew all about him,
and were more vigilant than their <i>confr&egrave;res</i> in London
and Dublin, so that Barrington, finding himself both
suspected and watched, came to the conclusion that
the air of Scotland was not good for him, and turned
his face southward. Unmindful of the terms of his
liberation, or careless as to the result of his return, he
again sought London, where, once more, he frequented
the theatres, the opera-house, and the Pantheon,
for some little time, with tolerable success&mdash;but
he was now too notorious to be long secure; he
was closely watched, and well-nigh detected at the
latter of these places; and, such strong suspicions of
his behaviour were entertained by the magistrates,
he was committed to Newgate, though on his trial
he was acquitted.</p>

<p>But he only escaped Scylla to be engulphed in
Charybdis, for one of the superintendents of convicts
had him detained for violating the conditions under
which he was liberated, and the consequence was
that he was made what was called ‘a fine in Newgate,’
that is, he had to serve out his unexpired term
of imprisonment there. This punishment he duly
suffered, and when he was once more set free, he at
once re-commenced his old practices, and lived a life
of shifts and roguery, until, in January, 1787, he was
detected in picking the pocket of a Mrs. Le Mesurier,
at Drury Lane Theatre, and was at once apprehended.
He was given in charge of a constable named
Blandy, but by some means, either by negligence
of his custodian, or by bribing him, he made his
escape.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>For this he was outlawed, and, whilst the offended
majesty of the law was thus seeking to vindicate
itself, he was making a progress of the northern
counties under various disguises, sometimes appearing
as a quack doctor, or a clergyman, then in connection
with a gaming-table, and occasionally playing
the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a rider (as commercial travellers were
then called) for some manufacturing firm. Although
frequently meeting with people who knew him, he
was never molested by them, until he was recognised
at Newcastle (whilst being examined in the
justice-room there, regarding a theft he had committed)
by a gentleman from London as being ‘wanted’
for the robbery at Drury Lane Theatre, and he was
promptly despatched to Bow Street once more. On
his arrival, he was committed to Newgate as an outlaw,
and, miserable and dejected, his spirits sank
within him. His friends, however (for even he had
friends) made up a purse of a hundred guineas for
his defence. His trial took place in November, 1789,
when he conducted his own defence, as usual, with
extraordinary ability, arguing the various points of
law with the judge with surprising acuteness and
elegant language, till, eventually, being aided by the
absence of a material witness, he made such an
impression upon the court that a verdict of acquittal
was recorded.</p>

<p>All these escapes, however, seem to have had no
deterrent effect upon him, and he again set off for
Ireland, where he joined an accomplice named
Hubert, who was speedily apprehended, in the act of
picking a pocket, and sentenced to seven years transportation.
Dublin after this was far too hot for
Barrington, so he adroitly made his escape to England,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
where, after rambling about the country for
some time, he re-appeared in London. But he had
not been in the metropolis very long before he was
apprehended, as his indictment says, for ‘stealing on
the 1st of September, 1780, in the parish of Enfield,
in the county of Middlesex, a gold watch, chain, seals,
and a metal key, the property of Henry Hare Townsend.’
The case was very clear, but Barrington defended
himself very ingeniously, and with a certain
amount of oratory, of which the following is a sample:</p>

<p>‘I am well convinced of the noble nature of a
British Court of Justice; the dignified and benign
principles of its judges, and the liberal and candid
spirit of its jurors.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen, life is the gift of God, and liberty its
greatest blessing; the power of disposing of both or
either is the greatest man can enjoy. It is also
adventitious that, great as that power is, it cannot
be better placed than in the hands of an English
jury; for they will not exercise it like tyrants, who
delight in blood, but like generous and brave men,
who delight to spare rather than destroy; and who,
forgetting they are men themselves, lean, when they
can, to the side of compassion. It may be thought,
gentlemen of the jury, that I am appealing to your
passions, and, if I had the power to do it, I would
not fail to employ it. The passions animate the
heart, and to the passions we are indebted for the
noblest actions, and to the passions we owe our
dearest and finest feelings; and, when it is considered,
the mighty power you now possess, whatever
leads to a cautious and tender discharge of it,
must be thought of great consequence: as long as
the passions conduct us on the side of benevolence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
they are our best, our safest, and our most friendly
guides.’</p>

<p>But all his eloquence was thrown away on a jury
of practical men, and they found him guilty. His
trial took place on the 15th of September, 1790, and
on the 22nd of September he received his sentence,
which was seven years’ transportation. He took his
leave dramatically, and made a speech lamenting his
hard fate throughout life.</p>

<p>‘The world, my Lord, has given me credit for
abilities, indeed much greater than I possess, and,
therefore, much more than I deserved; but I have
never found any kind hand to foster those abilities.</p>

<p>‘I might ask, where was the generous and powerful
hand that was ever stretched forth to rescue
George Barrington from infamy? In an age like
this, which, in several respects, is so justly famed for
liberal sentiments, it was my severe lot that no nobleminded
gentleman stepped forward and said to me,
“Barrington, you are possessed of talents which may
be useful to society. I feel for your situation, and, as
long as you act the part of a good citizen, I will be
your protector; you will then have time and opportunity
to rescue yourself from the obloquy of your
former conduct.”</p>

<p>‘Alas, my Lord, George Barrington had never the
supreme felicity of having such comfort administered
to his wounded spirit. As matters have unfortunately
turned out, the die is cast; and, as it is, I
bend, resigned to my fate, without one murmur or
complaint.’</p>

<p>Thus ended his life in England, which he was
never to see again, and it is with pleasure that we
can turn to a brighter page in his history.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>In his account of his voyage to New South Wales,
he says that it was with unspeakable satisfaction that
he received orders to embark, agreeably to his sentence;
and it is pleasing to observe that, under his
adverse circumstances, the friends he had made in
his prosperity did not forsake him in his adversity,
for many of them came to bid him adieu, and not
one of them came empty-handed; in fact, their
generosity was so great, that he had difficulty in
getting permission to take all their gifts on board.</p>

<p>His account of their embarkation gives us an
extremely graphic description not only of the treatment
of convicts, but of the unhappy wretches
themselves.</p>

<p>‘About a quarter before five, a general muster
took place, and, having bid farewell to my fellow-prisoners,
we were escorted from the prison to
Blackfriars Bridge by the City Guard, where two
lighters were waiting to receive us. This procession,
though early, and but few spectators, made a
deep impression on my mind, and the ignominy of
being thus mingled with felons of all descriptions,
many scarce a degree above the brute creation,
intoxicated with liquor, and shocking the ears of
those they passed with blasphemy, oaths, and songs,
the most offensive to modesty, inflicted a punishment
more severe than the sentence of my country, and
fully avenged that society I had so much wronged.’</p>

<p>And there is little doubt but that the moral repugnance
to his miserable, and vicious companions was
mainly the cause of the reformation which took place
in him.</p>

<p>The condition of convicts at that day was not
enviable. There were two hundred and fifty of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
them in the ship with Barrington, all packed in the
hold, their hammocks being slung within seventeen
inches of each other: being encumbered with their
irons, and deprived of fresh air, their condition was
soon rendered deplorable. To alleviate their sufferings
as much as possible, they were permitted to
walk the deck (as much as was consistent with the
safety of the ship), ten at a time; and the women, of
whom there were six on board, had a snug berth to
themselves. But, in spite of this humane and considerate
treatment, thirty-six of them died on the
voyage.</p>

<p>Barrington, however, was not in such evil case, for
a friend had accompanied him on board, and, by his
influence and exertions, had not only procured stowage
for his packages, but also liberty to walk the
deck unencumbered with irons. Nor did his help
stop here, for he prevailed upon the boatswain to
admit him into his mess, which consisted of the
second mate, carpenter, and gunner, on condition
that he paid his proportion towards defraying the
extra requisites for the mess during the voyage.
The boatswain, too, had his hammock slung next to
his own, so that his life was made as comfortable as
it could be, under the circumstances, and he had not
to herd with the convicts.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the Bay of Biscay, these gentlemen
began to give trouble. The captain, very
humanely, had released many of the weaker convicts
of their galling chains, and allowed them to
walk on deck, ten at a time. Two of them, who
were Americans, and had some knowledge of navigation,
prevailed upon the majority of their comrades
to attempt to seize the ship, impressing upon them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
that it would be an easy task, and that when
captured, they would sail to America, where every
man would not only obtain his liberty, but receive
a tract of land from Congress, besides a share of
the money arising from the sale of the ship and cargo.</p>

<p>The poor dupes swallowed the bait, and the mutineers
determined that on the first opportunity, whilst
the officers were at dinner, those convicts who were
on deck should force the arm-chest, which was kept
on the quarter-deck, and, at the same time, would
make a signal to two of them to attack the sentinels,
and obtain possession of their arms, while word was
passed for those below to come on deck. And, as
they planned, so they carried out the mutiny: when
the captain and officers were below examining the
stowage of some wine&mdash;a cask, in the spirit-room,
being leaky&mdash;and the only persons on deck were
Barrington and the man at the helm.</p>

<p>Barrington was going forward, but was stopped
by one of the Americans, followed by another convict,
who struck at him with a sword, which luckily hit
against a pistol that the American had pointed at
him. Barrington snatched up a handspike, and felled
one of them, and the steersman left his wheel and
called up the captain and crew. For a few moments
Barrington kept the mutineers at bay, when assistance
came&mdash;and a blunderbuss being fired amongst
the convicts, wounding several, they retreated, and
were all driven into the hold. An attempt of this
kind required the most exemplary punishment; and
two of the ring-leaders, with very short shrift, were
soon dangling at the yard-arm, whilst others were
tasting the cat-o’-nine-tails at the gangway.</p>

<p>The mutiny having been thus quelled, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
convicts re-ironed, the captain had leisure to thank
Barrington, and to compliment him on his gallant
behaviour in the emergency. He assured Barrington
that, when they arrived at the Cape, he would
reward him, and that, meanwhile, he was to have
every liberty; and orders were given to the steward
to supply him with anything he might have occasion
for during the voyage. As Barrington observes:</p>

<p>‘I soon experienced the good effects of my late
behaviour; as seldom a day passed but some fresh
meat or poultry was sent to me by the captain,
which considerably raised me in the estimation of
my messmates, who were no ways displeased at the
substitution of a sea-pie of fowl or fresh meat to a
dish of lobscouse, or a piece of salt-junk.’</p>

<p>On the ship’s arrival at the Cape, the captain gave
Barrington an order on a merchant there for one
hundred dollars, telling him he might at any time
avail himself of the ship’s boat going ashore, and
visit the town as often as he pleased, if he would
only tell the officers when he felt so inclined. It is
needless to say he fully availed himself of his
privilege, and laid out his money in the purchase
of goods most in demand in New South Wales.</p>

<p>On reaching Port Jackson, in consequence of the
captain’s report, he had a most gracious reception
from the governor, who, finding him a man of ability
and intelligence, almost immediately appointed him
superintendent of the convicts at Paramatta: his
business being chiefly to report the progress made
in the different works that were carried on there.
Here he had ample leisure and opportunities of studying
the natives and their habits and customs, and
in his ‘History of New South Wales,’ he gives an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
interesting account of the aborigines of Australia,
now so rapidly approaching extinction. The governor,
Philip, made unceasing efforts to win their friendship,
and even went to the extent of forcing his
acquaintance on them, by the summary method of
capturing a few, and keeping them in friendly durance;
hoping thus to gain their good-will, so that,
on their release, they might report to their friends
that the white man was not so bad as he was
represented. But it was all in vain; for, beyond a
very few converts to civilisation, the savage remained
untameable.</p>

<p>By the purchases which Barrington had made at
the Cape, as well as the presents he had brought
from England, he was enabled to furnish his house
in a rather better style than his neighbours, and,
moreover, he managed to collect around him a few
farm-yard animals, which, together with his great
love for horticulture, made his life far from unendurable.
His position, as peace-officer of the district,
was no sinecure; for the criminal population over
whom he had jurisdiction gave him very considerable
trouble, more especially after the introduction into
the settlement, by some American vessels, of New
England rum, the baneful effects of which were very
soon apparent: the partiality of the convicts for it
being incredible, for they preferred receiving it as
the price of their labour to any other article, either

<p>Barrington’s tact and good management in the
numerous disturbances that arose, as more convicts
were poured into the station, were very conspicuous,
and his conduct was altogether such as compensated,
in a great measure, for his former misdeeds. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
domestic matters improved by degrees, so that his
situation was equal, if not preferable, to that of most
of the settlers there, and, to crown all, in September,
1799, the Governor&mdash;Hunter&mdash;presented him with an
absolute pardon, complimenting him on his faithful
discharge of the duties which had been entrusted to
him, and the integrity and uniform uprightness of his
conduct, and, furthermore, said that his general
behaviour, during his whole residence, perfectly obliterated
every trace of his former indiscretions.</p>

<p>Barrington was further appointed a principal superintendent
of the district of Paramatta, with a permanent
salary of &pound;50 per annum (his situation having
been, hitherto, only provisional) and, eventually, the
confidence he inspired was such that he was raised
to the office of Chief of the constabulary force of the
Colony, on the principle, it may be presumed, of
‘setting a thief to catch a thief.’ In this post he gave
great satisfaction, and died, much respected by all
who knew him, at Botany Bay.</p>

<p>He wrote ‘The History of New South Wales,’ &amp;c.
London, 1802; a most valuable and interesting book.
‘An Account of a Voyage to New South Wales,’ London,
1803. ‘The History of New Holland,’ London,
1808; and a book was published with his name as
author, ‘The London Spy,’ which went through
several editions.

<p>But Milton laid no such interdict upon his poor
dead body&mdash;and it was not very long after his burial,
which took place in 1674, that the stone which covered
it, and indicated his resting-place, was removed,
as Aubrey tells us in his ‘Lives’ (vol. iii, p. 450). ‘His
stone is now removed. About two years since (1681)
the two steppes to the communion-table were raysed,
Ighesse, Jo. Speed,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and he lie together.’ And so it
came to pass that, in the church of St. Giles’, Cripplegate,
where he was buried, there was no memorial of
the place where he was laid, nor, indeed, anything
to mark the fact of his burial in that church until, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
1793, Samuel Whitbread set up a fine marble bust of
the poet, by Bacon, with an inscription giving the
dates of his birth and death, and recording the fact
that his father was also interred there.</p>

<p>It is probable that Mr. Whitbread was moved
thereto by the alleged desecration of Milton’s tomb
in 1790, of which there is a good account written by
Philip Neve, of Furnival’s Inn, which is entitled, ‘A
<span class="smcap">Narrative</span> of the <span class="smcap">Disinterment</span> of <span class="smcap">Milton’s</span> coffin, in
the Parish-Church of <span class="smcap">St. Giles</span>, Cripplegate, on Wednesday,
August 4th, 1790; and the <span class="smcap">Treatment of the
Corpse</span> during that and the following day.’</p>

<p>As this narrative is not long, I propose to give it
in its entirety, because to condense it would be to
spoil it, and, by giving it <i>in extenso</i>, the reader will be
better able to judge whether it was really Milton’s
body which was exhumed.</p>

<h3>A NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Having read in the <i>Public Advertiser</i>, on Saturday,
the 7th of August, 1790, that <i>Milton’s</i> coffin had been
dug up in the parish church of St. Giles, Cripplegate,
and was there to be seen, I went immediately to the
church, and found the latter part of the information
to be untrue; but, from conversations on that day, on
Monday, the 9th, and on Tuesday, the 10th of August,
with Mr. Thomas <i>Strong</i>, Solicitor and F.A.S., Red
Cross Street, <i>Vestry-Clerk</i>; Mr. John <i>Cole</i>, Barbican,
Silversmith, <i>Churchwarden</i>; Mr. John <i>Laming</i>, Barbican,
<i>Pawnbroker</i>; and Mr. <i>Fountain</i>, Beech Lane,
Publican, <i>Overseers</i>; Mr. <i>Taylor</i>, of Stanton, Derbyshire,
<i>Surgeon</i>; a friend of Mr. <i>Laming</i>, and a visitor
in his house; Mr. William <i>Ascough</i>, Coffin-maker, Fore
Street, <i>Parish Clerk</i>; Benjamin <i>Holmes</i> and Thomas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
<i>Hawkesworth</i>, journeymen to Mr. Ascough; Mrs.
<i>Hoppey</i>, Fore Street, <i>Sexton</i>; Mr. <i>Ellis</i>, No. 9, Lamb’s
Chapel, comedian of the Royalty-theatre; and John
<i>Poole</i> (son of Rowland Poole), Watch-spring maker,
Jacob’s Passage, Barbican, the following facts are
established:</p>

<p>It being in the contemplation of some persons to
bestow a considerable sum of money in erecting a
monument, in the parish church of <i>St. Giles</i>, Cripplegate,
to the memory of <i>Milton</i>, and the particular spot
of his interment in that church having for many
years past been ascertained only by tradition, several
of the principal parishioners have, at their meetings,
frequently expressed a wish that his coffin should be
dug for, that incontestable evidence of its exact
situation might be established, before the said monument
should be erected. The entry, among the
burials, in the register-book, 12th of November, 1674,
is ‘<i>John Milton</i>, Gentleman, consumption, <i>chancell</i>.’
The church of St. Giles, Cripplegate, was built in 1030,
was burnt down (except the steeple) and rebuilt in
1545; was repaired in 1682; and again in 1710. In
the repair of 1782, an alteration took place in the
disposition of the inside of the church; the pulpit
was removed from the second pillar, against which it
stood, north of the chancel, to the south side of the
present chancel, which was then formed, and pews
were built over the old chancel. The tradition has
always been that <i>Milton</i> was buried in the chancel,
under the clerk’s desk; but the circumstance of the
alteration in the church, not having, of late years,
been attended to, the clerk, sexton, and other officers
of the parish have misguided inquirers, by showing
the spot under the clerk’s desk, in the present chancel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
as the place of <i>Milton’s</i> interment. I have twice,
at different periods, been shown that spot as the
place where <i>Milton</i> lay. Even Mr. <i>Baskerville</i>, who
died a few years ago, and who had requested, in his
will, to be buried by <i>Milton</i>, was deposited in the
above-mentioned spot of the present chancel, in pious
intention of compliance with his request. The church
is now, August, 1790, under a general repair, by contract,
for &pound;1,350, and Mr. <i>Strong</i>, Mr. <i>Cole</i>, and other
parishioners, having very prudently judged that the
search would be made with much less inconvenience
to the parish at this time, when the church is under
repair, than at any period after the said repair should
be completed, Mr. <i>Cole</i>, in the last days of July,
ordered the workmen to dig in search of the coffin.
Mr. <i>Ascough</i>, his father, and grandfather, have been
parish clerks of <i>St. Giles</i> for upwards of ninety years
past. His grandfather, who died in February, 1759-60,
aged eighty-four, used often to say that <i>Milton</i> had been
buried under the clerk’s desk in the chancel. John
<i>Poole</i>, aged seventy, used to hear his father talk of
Milton’s person, from those who had seen him; and
also, that he lay under the common-councilmen’s
pew. The common-councilmen’s pew is built over
that very part of the old chancel, where the former
clerk’s desk stood. These traditions in the parish reported
to Mr. <i>Strong</i> and Mr. <i>Cole</i> readily directed
them to dig from the present chancel, northwards,
towards the pillar, against which the former pulpit
and desk had stood. On Tuesday afternoon, August
3rd, notice was brought to Messrs. <i>Strong</i> and <i>Cole</i>
that the coffin was discovered. They went immediately
to the church, and, by help of a candle, proceeded
under the common-councilmen’s pew to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
place where the coffin lay. It was in a chalky soil,
and directly over a wooden coffin, supposed to be that
of <i>Milton’s</i> father; tradition having always reported
that <i>Milton</i> was buried next to his father. The
registry of the father of <i>Milton</i>, among the burials,
in the parish-book, is ‘<i>John Melton</i>, Gentleman, 15th of
March, 1646-7.’ In digging through the whole space
from the present chancel, where the ground was
opened, to the situation of the former clerk’s desk,
there was not found any other coffin, which could
raise the smallest doubt of this being <i>Milton’s</i>. The
two oldest found in the ground had inscriptions,
which Mr. <i>Strong</i> copied; they were of as late dates
as 1727 and 1739. When he and Mr. <i>Cole</i> had
examined the coffin, they ordered water and a brush
to be brought, that they might wash it, in search of
an inscription, or initials, or date; but, upon its being
carefully cleansed, none was found.</p>

<p>The following particulars were given me in writing
by Mr. <i>Strong</i>, and they contain the admeasurement
of the coffin, as taken by him, with a rule. ‘A
leaden coffin, found under the common-councilmen’s
pew, on the north side of the chancel, nearly under
the place where the old pulpit and clerk’s desk stood.
The coffin appeared to be old, much corroded, and
without any inscription or plate upon it. It was, in
length, five feet ten inches, and in width, at the
broadest part, over the shoulders, one foot four
inches.’ Conjecture naturally pointed out, both to
Mr. <i>Strong</i> and Mr. <i>Cole</i>, that, by moving the leaden
coffin, there would be a great chance of finding some
inscription on the wooden one underneath; but, with
a just and laudable piety, they disdained to disturb
the sacred ashes, after a requiem of one hundred and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
sixteen years; and having satisfied their curiosity,
and ascertained the fact, which was the subject of it,
Mr. <i>Cole</i> ordered the ground to be closed. This was
on the afternoon of Tuesday, August the 3rd; and,
when I waited on Mr. <i>Strong</i>, on Saturday morning,
the 7th, he informed me that the coffin had been
found on the Tuesday, had been examined, washed,
and measured by him and Mr. <i>Cole</i>; but that the
ground had been immediately closed, when they
left the church;&mdash;not doubting that Mr. <i>Cole’s</i> order
had been punctually obeyed. But the direct contrary
appears to have been the fact.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, the 3rd, Mr. <i>Cole</i>, Messrs.
<i>Laming</i> and <i>Taylor</i>, <i>Holmes</i>, &amp;c., had a <i>merry meeting</i>,
as Mr. <i>Cole</i> expresses himself, at Fountain’s house;
the conversation there turned upon <i>Milton’s</i> coffin
having been discovered; and, in the course of the
evening, several of those present expressing a desire
to see it, Mr. <i>Cole</i> assented that, if the ground was
not already closed, the closing of it should be deferred
until they should have satisfied their curiosity.
Between eight and nine on Wednesday morning, the
4th, the two overseers (<i>Laming</i> and <i>Fountain</i>) and
Mr. <i>Taylor</i>, went to the house of <i>Ascough</i>, the clerk,
which leads into the church-yard, and asked for
<i>Holmes</i>; they then went with <i>Holmes</i> into the church,
and pulled the coffin, which lay deep in the ground,
from its original station to the edge of the excavation,
into day-light. Mr. <i>Laming</i> told me that, to
assist in thus removing it, he put his hand into a
corroded hole, which he saw in the lead, at the coffin
foot. When they had thus removed it, the overseers
asked <i>Holmes</i> if he could open it, that they might
see the body. <i>Holmes</i> immediately fetched a mallet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and a chisel, and cut open the top of the coffin,
slantwise from the head, as low as the breast; so
that the top, being doubled backward, they could
see the corpse; he cut it open also at the foot. Upon
first view of the body, it appeared perfect, and completely
enveloped in the shroud, which was of many
folds; the ribs standing up regularly. When they
disturbed the shroud, the ribs fell. Mr. <i>Fountain</i> told
me that he pulled hard at the teeth, which resisted,
until some one hit them a knock with a stone, when
they easily came out. There were but five in the
upper jaw, which were all perfectly sound and white,
and all taken by Mr. <i>Fountain</i>; he gave one of them
to Mr. <i>Laming</i>; Mr. <i>Laming</i> also took one from the
lower jaw; and Mr. <i>Taylor</i> took two from it. Mr.
<i>Laming</i> told me that he had, at one time, a mind to
bring away the whole under-jaw, with the teeth in it;
he had it in his hand, but tossed it back again. Also
that he lifted up the head, and saw a great quantity of
hair, which lay straight and even behind the head, and
in the state of hair which had been combed and tied
together before interment; but it was wet, the coffin
having considerable corroded holes, both at the head
and foot, and a great part of the water with which
it had been washed on the Tuesday afternoon having
run into it. The overseers and Mr. <i>Taylor</i> went
away soon afterwards, and Messrs. <i>Laming</i> and
<i>Taylor</i> went home to get scissors to cut off some
of the hair: they returned about ten, when Mr.
<i>Laming</i> poked his stick against the head, and brought
some of the hair over the forehead; but, as they saw
the scissors were not necessary, Mr. <i>Taylor</i> took up
the hair, as it lay on the forehead, and carried it
home. The water, which had got into the coffin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
on the Tuesday afternoon, had made a sludge at the
bottom of it, emitting a nauseous smell, and which
occasioned Mr. <i>Laming</i> to use his stick to procure
the hair, and not to lift up the head a second time.
Mr. <i>Laming</i> also took out one of the leg-bones, but
threw it in again. <i>Holmes</i> went out of church, whilst
Messrs. <i>Laming</i>, <i>Taylor</i>, and <i>Fountain</i> were there the
first time, and he returned when the two former were
come the second time. When Messrs. <i>Laming</i> and
<i>Taylor</i> had finally quitted the church, the coffin was
removed from the edge of the excavation back to its
original station; but was no otherwise closed than
by the lid, where it had been cut and reversed, being
bent down again. Mr. <i>Ascough</i>, the clerk, was from
home the greater part of that day, and Mrs. <i>Hoppey</i>,
the sexton, was from home the whole day. Elizabeth
<i>Grant</i>, the grave-digger, who is servant to Mrs.
<i>Hoppey</i>, therefore now took possession of the coffin;
and, as its situation under the common-councilmen’s
pew would not admit of its being seen without the
help of a candle, she kept a tinder-box in the excavation,
and, when any persons came, struck a light,
and conducted them under the pew, where, by
reversing the part of the lid which had been cut, she
exhibited the body, at first for sixpence, and afterwards
for threepence and twopence each person. The workers
in the church kept the doors locked to all those who
would not pay the price of a pot of beer for entrance,
and many, to avoid that payment, got in at a window
at the west end of the church, near to Mr. <i>Ascough’s</i>
counting-house.</p>

<p>I went on Saturday, the 7th, to Mr. <i>Laming’s</i> house,
to request a lock of the hair; but, not meeting with
Mr. <i>Taylor</i> at home, went again on Monday, the 9th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
when Mr. <i>Taylor</i> gave me part of what hair he had
reserved for himself. <i>Hawkesworth</i> having informed
me, on the Saturday, that Mr. <i>Ellis</i>, the player, had
taken some hair, and that he had seen him take a
rib-bone, and carry it away in paper under his coat,
I went from Mr. <i>Laming’s</i> on Monday to Mr. <i>Ellis</i>,
who told me that he had paid 6<sup>d.</sup> to Elizabeth <i>Grant</i>
for seeing the body; and that he had lifted up the
head, and taken from the sludge under it a small
quantity of hair, with which was a piece of the
shroud, and, adhering to the hair, a bit of the skin
of the skull, of about the size of a shilling. He
then put them all into my hands, with the rib-bone,
which appeared to be one of the upper ribs. The
piece of the shroud was of coarse linen. The hair
which he had taken was short; a small part of it
he had washed, and the remainder was in the clotted
state in which he had taken it. He told me that
he had tried to reach down as low as the hands of
the corpse, but had not been able to effect it. The
washed hair corresponded exactly with that in my
possession, and which I had just received from Mr.
<i>Taylor</i>. <i>Ellis</i> is a very ingenious worker in hair,
and he said that, thinking it would be of great
advantage to him to possess a quantity of Milton’s
hair, he had returned to the church on Thursday,
and had made his endeavours to get access a second
time to the body; but had been refused admittance.
<i>Hawkesworth</i> took a tooth, and broke a bit off the
coffin; of which I was informed by Mr. <i>Ascough</i>. I
purchased them both of <i>Hawkesworth</i>, on Saturday
the 7th, for 2<sup>s.</sup>; and he told me that, when
he took the tooth out, there were but two more
remaining; one of which was afterwards taken by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
another of Mr. <i>Ascough’s</i> men. And <i>Ellis</i> informed
me that, at the time when he was there, on Wednesday,
the teeth were all gone; but the overseers say
they think that all the teeth were not taken out
of the coffin, though displaced from the jaws, but
that some of them must have fallen among the
other bones, as they very readily came out, after
the first were drawn. <i>Haslib</i>, son of William <i>Haslib</i>,
of Jewin Street, undertaker, took one of the small
bones, which I purchased of him, on Monday, the
9th, for 2<sup>s.</sup></p>

<p>With respect to the identity of the person; anyone
must be a skeptic against violent presumptions
to entertain a doubt of its being that of <i>Milton</i>. The
parish traditions of the spot; the age of the coffin&mdash;none
other found in the ground which can at all
contest with it, or render it suspicious&mdash;<i>Poole’s</i> tradition
that those who had conversed with his father
about <i>Milton’s</i> person always described him to have
been thin, with long hair; the entry in the register-book
that <i>Milton</i> died of consumption, are all strong
confirmations, with the size of the coffin, of the
identity of the person. If it be objected that, against
the pillar where the pulpit formerly stood, and immediately
over the common-councilmen’s pew, is a
monument to the family of <i>Smith</i>, which shows that
‘near that place’ were buried, in 1653, <i>Richard Smith</i>,
aged 17; in 1655, <i>John Smith</i>, aged 32; and in
1664, <i>Elizabeth Smith</i>, the mother, aged 64; and
in 1675, <i>Richard Smith</i>, the father, aged 85; it may
be answered that, if the coffin in question be one
of these, the others should be there also. The corpse
is certainly not that of a man of 85; and, if it be
supposed one of the first named males of the <i>Smith</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
family, certainly the two later coffins should appear;
but none such were found, nor could that monument
have been erected until many years after the death
of the last person mentioned in the inscription; and
it was then placed there, as it expresses, not by any
of the family, but at the expense of friends. The
flatness of the pillar, after the pulpit had been removed,
offered an advantageous situation for it; and
‘<i>near this place</i>,’ upon a mural monument, will always
admit of a liberal construction. <i>Holmes</i>, who is much
respected in that parish, and very ingenious and
intelligent in his business, says that a leaden coffin,
when the inner wooden-case is perished, must, from
pressure and its own weight, shrink in breadth, and
that, therefore, more than the present admeasurement
of this coffin across the shoulders must have been
its original breadth. There is evidence, also, that
it was incurvated, both on the top and at the sides,
at the time when it was discovered. But the strongest
of all confirmations is the hair, both in its length
and colour. Behold <i>Faithorne’s</i> quarto-print of <i>Milton</i>
taken <i>ad vivum</i> in 1760, five years before <i>Milton’s</i>
death. Observe the short locks growing towards
the forehead, and the long ones flowing from the same
place down the sides of the face. The whole quantity
of hair which Mr. <i>Taylor</i> took was from the
forehead, and all taken at one grasp. I measured
on Monday morning, the 9th, that lock of it which
he had given to Mr. <i>Laming</i>, six inches and a half
by a rule; and the lock of it which he gave to me,
taken at the same time, and from the same place,
measures only two inches and a half. In the reign
of <i>Charles</i> II. how few, besides <i>Milton</i>, wore their own
hair! <i>Wood</i> says <i>Milton</i> had light-brown hair, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
very description of that which we possess; and,
what may seem extraordinary, it is yet so strong
that Mr. <i>Laming</i>, to cleanse it from its clotted state,
let the cistern-cock run on it for near a minute, and
then rubbed it between his fingers without injury.</p>

<p><i>Milton’s</i> coffin lay open from Wednesday morning,
the 4th, at 9 o’clock until 4 o’clock in the afternoon
of the following day, when the ground was closed.</p>

<p>With respect to there being no inscriptions on the
coffin, <i>Holmes</i> says that inscription-plates were not
used, nor invented at the time when <i>Milton</i> was
buried; that the practice then was to paint the
inscription on the outside wooden coffin, which in
this case was entirely perished.</p>

<p>It has never been pretended that any hair was taken
except by Mr. <i>Taylor</i>, and by <i>Ellis</i> the player; and
all which the latter took would, when cleansed,
easily lie in a small locket. Mr. <i>Taylor</i> has divided
his share into many small parcels; and the
lock which I saw in Mr. <i>Laming’s</i> hands on Saturday
morning, the 7th, and which then measured six inches
and a half, had been so cut and reduced by divisions
among Mr. <i>Laming’s</i> friends, at noon, on Monday, the
9th, that he thus possessed only a small bit, from two
to three inches in length.</p>

<p>All the teeth are remarkably short, below the gums.
The five which were in the upper jaw, and the
middle teeth of the lower, are perfect and white.
Mr. <i>Fountain</i> took the five upper jaw teeth; Mr.
<i>Laming</i> one from the lower jaw; Mr. <i>Taylor</i> two from
it; <i>Hawkesworth</i> one; and another of Mr. <i>Ascough’s</i>
men one; besides these, I have not been able to trace
any, nor have I heard that any more were taken. It
is not probable that more than ten should have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
brought away, if the conjecture of the overseers,
that some dropped among the other bones, be
founded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In recording a transaction which will strike every
liberal mind with horror and disgust, I cannot omit
to declare that I have procured those relics which I
possess, only in hope of bearing part in a pious and
honourable restitution of all that has been taken; the
sole atonement which can now be made to the violated
rights of the dead; to the insulted parishioners
at large; and to the feelings of all good men. During
the present repair of the church, the mode is
obvious and easy. Unless that be done, in vain will
the parish hereafter boast a sumptuous monument to
the memory of <i>Milton</i>; it will but display their shame
in proportion to its magnificence.</p>

<p>I collected this account from the mouths of those
who were immediate actors in this most sacrilegious
scene; and before the voice of charity had reproached
them with their impiety. By it those are exculpated
whose just and liberal sentiments restrained
their hands from an act of violation, and the blood
of the lamb is dashed against the door-posts of the
perpetrators, not to save, but to mark them to posterity.</p>

<span class="i4">14th of August, 1790.</span>
</p>

<p>This Mr. Neve, whose pious horror at the sacrilegious
desecration of the poet’s tomb seems only to
have been awakened at the eleventh hour, and whose
restitution of the relics he obtained does not appear,
was probably the P.N. who was the author, in 1789,
of ‘Cursory Remarks on some of the Ancient English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Poets, particularly Milton.’ It is a work of some erudition,
but the hero of the book, as its title plainly shows,
was Milton. Neve places him in the first rank, and can
hardly find words with which to extol his genius and
intellect, so that, probably, some hero-worship was
interwoven in the foregoing relation of the discovery
of Milton’s body; and it may be as well if the other
side were heard, although the attempt at refutation is
by no means as well authenticated as Neve’s narrative.
It is anonymous, and appeared in the <i>St.
James’s Chronicle</i>, September 4-7th, 1790, and in the
<i>European Magazine</i>, vol. xviii, pp. 206-7, for September,
1790, and is as follows:</p>

<h3>MILTON.</h3>

<p class="hang"><i>Reasons why it is impossible that the Coffin lately dug
up in the Parish Church of St. Giles, Cripplegate,
should contain the reliques of</i> <span class="smcap">Milton</span>.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> <span class="smcap">Because</span> <i>Milton</i> was buried in 1674, and
this coffin was found in a situation previously allotted
to a wealthy family, unconnected with his own.&mdash;See
the mural monument of the <i>Smiths</i>, dated 1653, &amp;c.,
immediately over the place of the supposed <span class="smcap">Milton’s</span>
interment.&mdash;In the time that the fragments of several
other sarcophagi were found; together with two
skulls, many bones, and a leaden coffin, which was
left untouched because it lay further to the north,
and (for some reason, or no reason at all) was unsuspected
of being the <i>Miltonic</i> reservoir.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The hair of <span class="smcap">Milton</span> is uniformly described
and represented as of a light hue; but far the
greater part of the ornament of his pretended skull
is of the darkest brown, without any mixture of gray.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
This difference is irreconcilable to probability. Our
hair, after childhood, is rarely found to undergo a
total change of colour, and <span class="smcap">Milton</span> was 66 years
old when he died, a period at which human locks, in
a greater or less degree, are interspersed with white.
Why did the Overseers, &amp;c., bring away only such
hair as corresponded with the description of <i>Milton’s</i>?
Of the light hair there was little; of the dark a
considerable quantity. But this circumstance would
have been wholly suppressed, had not a second
scrutiny taken place.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> Because the skull in question is remarkably
flat and small, and with the lowest of all possible
foreheads; whereas the head of <span class="smcap">Milton</span> was large,
and his brow conspicuously high. See his portrait
so often engraved by the accurate <i>Vertue</i>, who was
completely satisfied with the authenticity of his
original. We are assured that the surgeon who
attended at the second disinterment of the corpse
only remarked, ‘that the little forehead there was,
was prominent.’</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i> Because the hands of <span class="smcap">Milton</span> were full
of chalk stones. Now it chances that his substitute’s
left hand had been undisturbed, and therefore was in
a condition to be properly examined. No vestige,
however, of cretaceous substances was visible in it,
although they are of a lasting nature, and have
been found on the fingers of a dead person almost
coeval with <span class="smcap">Milton</span>.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly.</i> Because there is reason to believe that
the aforesaid remains are those of a young female
(one of the three Miss <i>Smiths</i>); for the bones are
delicate, the teeth small, slightly inserted in the jaw,
and perfectly white, even, and sound. From the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
corroded state of the pelvis, nothing could, with
certainty, be inferred; nor would the surgeon already
mentioned pronounce <i>absolutely</i> on the sex of the
deceased. Admitting, however, that the body was a
male one, its very situation points it out to be a male
of the <i>Smith</i> family; perhaps the favourite son <i>John</i>,
whom <i>Richard Smith</i>, Esq., his father, so feelingly
laments. (See Peck’s ‘<i>Desiderata Curiosa</i>,’ p. 536).<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
To this darling child a receptacle of lead might have
been allotted, though many other relatives of the
same house were left to putrefy in wood.</p>

<p><i>Sixthly.</i> Because <span class="smcap">Milton</span> was not in affluence<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>&mdash;expired
in an emaciated state, in a cold month, and
was interred by direction of his widow. An expensive
outward coffin of lead, therefore, was needless,
and unlikely to have been provided by a rapacious
woman who oppressed her husband’s children while
he was living, and cheated them after he was dead.</p>

<p><i>Seventhly.</i> Because it is improbable that the circumstance
of <span class="smcap">Milton’s</span> having been deposited under
the desk should, if true, have been so effectually
concealed from the whole train of his biographers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
It was, nevertheless, produced as an ancient and
well-known tradition, as soon as the parishioners of
Cripplegate were aware that such an incident was
gaped for by antiquarian appetence, and would be
swallowed by antiquarian credulity. How happened
it that Bishop <i>Newton</i>, who urged similar inquiries
concerning <span class="smcap">Milton</span> above forty years ago in the same
parish, could obtain no such information?<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p><i>Eighthly.</i> Because Mr. <i>Laming</i> (see Mr. <i>Neve’s</i>
pamphlet, second edition, p. 19) observes that the
‘sludge’ at the bottom of the coffin ‘emitted a
nauseous smell.’ But, had this corpse been as old as
that of <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, it must have been disarmed of its
power to offend, nor would have supplied the least
effluvium to disgust the nostrils of our delicate inquirer
into the secrets of the grave. The last remark
will seem to militate against a foregoing one. The
whole difficulty, however, may be solved by a resolution
not to believe a single word said on such an
occasion by any of those who invaded the presumptive
sepulchre of <span class="smcap">Milton</span>. The man who can handle
pawned stays, breeches, and petticoats without
disgust may be supposed to have his organs of
smelling in no very high state of perfection.</p>

<p><i>Ninthly.</i> Because we have not been told by
<i>Wood</i>, <i>Philips</i>, <i>Richardson</i>, <i>Toland</i>, etc., that Nature,
among her other partialities to <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, had indulged
him with an uncommon share of teeth. And yet
above a hundred have been sold as the furniture of
his mouth by the conscientious worthies who assisted
in the plunder of his supposed carcase, and finally
submitted it to every insult that brutal vulgarity
could devise and express. Thanks to fortune, however,
his corpse has hitherto been violated but by
proxy! May his genuine reliques (if aught of him
remains unmingled with common earth) continue to
elude research, at least while the present overseers of
the poor of Cripplegate are in office. Hard, indeed,
would have been the fate of the author of ‘Paradise
Lost’ to have received shelter in a chancel, that a
hundred and sixteen years after his interment his
<i>domus ultima</i> might be ransacked by two of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
lowest human beings, a retailer of spirituous liquors,
and a man who lends sixpences to beggars on such
despicable securities as tattered bed-gowns, cankered
porridge-pots, and rusty gridirons.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> <i>Cape saxa manu,
cape robora, pastor!</i> But an Ecclesiastical Court may
yet have cognisance of this more than savage transaction.
It will then be determined whether our
tombs are our own, or may be robbed with impunity
by the little tyrants of a workhouse.</p>

<p>Who, after a perusal of the foregoing remarks
(which are founded on circumstantial truth), will congratulate
the parishioners of St. Giles, Cripplegate, on
their discovery and treatment of the imaginary dust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
of <span class="smcap">Milton</span>? His favourite, <i>Shakespeare</i>, most fortunately
reposes at a secure distance from the paws
of Messieurs <i>Laming</i> and <i>Fountain</i>, who, otherwise,
might have provoked the vengeance imprecated by
our great dramatic poet on the remover of his bones.</p>

<p>From the preceding censures, however, Mr. <i>Cole</i>
(Churchwarden), and Messrs. <i>Strong</i> and <i>Ascough</i>
(Vestry and Parish Clerks), should, in the most distinguished
manner, be exempted. Throughout the
whole of this extraordinary business, they conducted
themselves with the strictest decency and propriety.
It should also be confessed, by those whom curiosity
has since attracted to the place of <span class="smcap">Milton’s</span> supposed
disinterment, that the politeness of the same parish
officers could only be exceeded by their respect for
our illustrious author’s memory, and their concern at
the complicated indignity which his nominal ashes
have sustained.’</p>

<p>Now it was hardly likely that Mr. Neve, with the
extremely plausible case that he had, would sit still
and see his pet theory knocked on the head, so he
issued a second edition of his pamphlet with this</p>

<h3>POSTSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>As some reports have been circulated, and some
anonymous papers have appeared, since the publication
of this pamphlet, with intent to induce a belief
that the corpse mentioned in it is that of a woman,
and as the curiosity of the public now calls for a
second impression of it, an opportunity is offered of
relating a few circumstances which have happened
since the 14th of August, and which, in some degree,
may confirm the opinion that the corpse is that of
<i>Milton</i>.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 16th, I called upon the overseer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
Mr. <i>Fountain</i>, when he told me that the parish officers
had then seen a surgeon who, on Wednesday the 4th,
had got through a window into the church, and who
had, upon inspection, pronounced the corpse to be
that of a woman. I thought it very improbable that
a surgeon should creep through a window, who could
go through a door for a few half-pence; but I no
otherwise expressed my doubts of the truth of the
information than by asking for the surgeon’s address.
I was answered ‘that the gentleman begged not to
have it known, that he might not be interrupted by
enquiries.’ A trifling relic was, nevertheless, at the
same time withholden, which I had expected to
receive through Mr. <i>Fountain’s</i> hands; by which it
appeared that those in possession of them were, still
tenacious of the spoils of the coffin, although they
affected to be convinced they were not those of
<i>Milton</i>. These contradictions, however, I reserved
for the test of an inquiry elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the course of that week I was informed that
some gentlemen had, on Tuesday, the 17th, prevailed
on the churchwardens to suffer a second disinterment
of the coffin, which had taken place on that day. On
Saturday, the 21st, I waited on Mr. <i>Strong</i>, who told
me that he had been present at such second disinterment,
and that he had then sent for an experienced
surgeon of the neighbourhood, who, upon inspection
and examination of the corpse, had pronounced it to
be that of a man. I was also informed, on that day,
the 21st, by a principal person of the parish, whose
information cannot be suspected, that the parish
officers had agreed among themselves that, from my
frequent visits and inquiries, I must have an intention
of delivering some account of the transaction to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
world; and that, therefore, to stop the narrative from
going forth, they must invent some story of a surgeon’s
inspection on the 4th, and of his declaration that the
corpse was that of a woman. From this information
it was easy to judge what would be the fate of any
personal application to the parish officers, with intent
to obtain a restitution of what had been taken from
the coffin I, therefore, on Wednesday, the 25th,
addressed the following letter to Mr. <i>Strong</i>:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>‘The reflection of a few moments, after I
left you on Saturday, clearly showed me that the
probability of the coffin in question being <i>Milton’s</i>
was not at all weakened, either by the dates, or the
number of persons on the <i>Smiths’</i> monument; but
that it was rather confirmed by the latter circumstance.
By the evidence which you told me was
given by the surgeon, called in on Tuesday, the 17th,
the corpse is that of a male; it is certainly not that of
a man of eighty-five; if, therefore, it be one of the
earlier buried <i>Smiths</i>, all the later coffins of that family
should appear, but not one of them is found. I, then,
suppose the monument to have been put there because
the flat pillar, after the pulpit was removed, offered a
convenient situation for it, and “<i>near this place</i>” to be
open, as it is in almost every case where it appears,
to very liberal interpretation.</p>

<p>‘It is, therefore, to be believed that the unworthy
treatment, on the 4th, was offered to the corpse
of <i>Milton</i>. Knowing what I know, I must not be
silent. It is a very unpleasant story to relate; but,
as it has fallen to my task, I will not shrink from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
it. I respect nothing in this world more than truth,
and the memory of <i>Milton</i>; and to swerve in a tittle
from the first would offend the latter. I shall give the
plain and simple narrative, as delivered by the parties
themselves. If it sit heavy on any of their shoulders,
it is a burthen of their own taking up, and their
own backs must bear it. They are all, as I find,
very fond of deriving honour to themselves from
<i>Milton</i>, as their parishioner; perhaps the mode, which
I have hinted, is the only one which they have now
left themselves of proving an equal desire to do
honour to him. If I had thought that, in personally
proposing to the parish officers a general search
for, and collection of, all the spoils, and to put them,
together with the mangled corpse and old coffin,
into a new leaden one, I should have been attended
to, I would have taken that method; but, when I
found such impertinent inventions as setting up a
fabulous surgeon to creep in at a window practised,
I felt that so low an attempt at derision would
ensure that, whatever I should afterwards propose,
would be equally derided, and I had then left no
other means than to call in the public opinion in
aid of my own, and to hope that we should, at
length, see the bones of an honest man, and the first
scholar and poet our country can boast, restored to
their sepulchre.</p>

<p>‘The narrative will appear, I believe, either to-morrow
or on Friday; whenever it does, your withers
are unwrung, and Mr. <i>Cole</i> has shown himself an
upright churchwarden.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>
<p>‘I cannot conclude without returning you many
thanks for your great civilities, and am, &amp;c.’
</p>

<p>The corpse was found entirely mutilated by those
who disinterred it on the 17th; almost all the ribs,
the lower jaw, and one of the hands gone. Of
all those who saw the body on Wednesday, the
4th, and on Thursday, the 5th, there is not one
person who discovered a single hair of any other
colour than light brown, although both Mr. <i>Laming</i>
and Mr. <i>Ellis</i> lifted up the head, and although the
considerable quantity of hair which Mr. <i>Taylor</i> took
was from the top of the head, and that which <i>Ellis</i>
took was from behind it; yet, from the accounts
of those who saw it on the 17th, it appears that
the hair on the back of the head was found of dark
brown, nearly approaching to black, although all
the front hair remaining was of the same light brown
as that taken on the 4th. It does not belong to me
either to account for or to prove the fact.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, September the 1st, I waited on
Mr. <i>Dyson</i>, who was the gentleman sent for on the
17th, to examine the corpse. I asked him simply,
whether, from what had then appeared before him,
he judged it to be male or female? His answer was
that, having examined the pelvis and the skull, he
judged the corpse to be that of a man. I asked
what was the shape of the head? He said that the
forehead was high and erect, though the top of
the head was flat; and added that the skull was
of that shape and flatness at the top which, differing
from those of blacks, is observed to be common
and almost peculiar to persons of very comprehensive
intellects. I am a stranger to this sort of knowledge,
but the opinion is a strong confirmation that, from
all the premises before him, he judged the head to
be that of <i>Milton</i>. On a paper, which he showed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
me, enclosing a bit of the hair, he had written
‘<i>Milton’s hair</i>.’</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Dyson</i> is a surgeon, who received his professional
education under the late Dr. <i>Hunter</i>, is in
partnership with Mr. <i>Price</i>, in Fore Street, where
the church stands, is of easy access, and his affability
can be exceeded only by his skill in an extensive
line of practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Taylor</i>, too, who is a surgeon of considerable
practice and eminence in his county, judged the corpse,
on the 4th, to be that of a male.</p>

<p>A man, also, who has for many years acted as grave-digger
in that parish, and who was present on the
17th, decided, upon first sight of the skull, that it
was male; with as little hesitation, he pronounced
another, which had been thrown out of the ground
in digging, to be that of a woman. Decisions obviously
the result of practical, rather than of scientific
knowledge; for, being asked his reasons, he
could give none, but that observation had taught
him to distinguish such subjects. Yet this latter
sort of evidence is not to be too hastily rejected;
it may not be understood by everybody, but to anyone
acquainted with those who are eminently skilled
in judging of the genuineness of ancient coins, it
will be perfectly intelligible. In that difficult and
useful art, the eye of a proficient decides at once;
a novice, however, who should inquire for the reasons
of such decision, would seldom receive a further answer
than that the decision itself is the result of
experience and observation, and that the eye can
be instructed only by long familiarity with the subject;
yet all numismatic knowledge rests upon this
sort of judgment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>After these evidences, what proofs are there, or
what probable presumptions, that the corpse is that
of a woman?</p>

<p>It was necessary to relate these facts, not only as
they belonged to the subject, but lest, from the
reports and papers above mentioned, I might, otherwise,
seem to have given either an unfaithful or a
partial statement of the evidences before me; whereas
now it will clearly be seen what facts appeared on
the first disinterment, which preceded, and what are
to be attributed to the second, which succeeded the
date of the narrative.</p>

<p>I have now added every circumstance which has
hitherto come to my knowledge relative to this extraordinary
transaction, and conclude with this declaration,
that I should be very glad if any person would,
from facts, give me reason to believe that the corpse
in question is rather that of <i>Elizabeth Smith</i>, whose
name I know only from her monument, than that of
<i>John Milton</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> only knowledge which very many
people possess of the life and crime of
Eugene Aram has been derived from the
popular romance bearing his name,
written by the late Lord Lytton. And
this nobleman, influenced by his individual bias, has
so woven fiction with a small modicum of fact, as to
render the story, as a history of a celebrated crime,
totally unreliable. Stripped of the gloss Lord Lytton
has given it, and revealed in its bare nakedness, it
shows Eugene Aram in a very different light from the
solitary scholar, surrounded by books, with high,
romantic aspirations and noble thoughts, winning the
love of a pure and lovely girl; it shows us instead a
poor country school-master, clever, but self-taught,
married to a common woman, whose very faith he
doubted, struggling with poverty, and heavily weighed
down with several children; it paints him as a
man whose companions were sordid and dishonest,
whilst he himself was a liar, a thief, and a murderer,
a selfish man who scrupled not to leave wife and
children to shift for themselves, a man untrustworthy
in his relations of life.</p>

<p>Eugenius, or Eugene Aram was born in the year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
1704,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> at Ramsgill, a little village in Netherdale,
Yorkshire, and his father was a gardener, as he says,
of great abilities in botany, and an excellent draughtsman,
who served Dr. Compton, Bishop of London,
and, afterwards, Sir Edward Blackett, of Newby, and
Sir John Ingilby, of Ripley. When he was five or
six years of age, the family removed to Bondgate,
near Ripon, his father having purchased a little property
there. Here he was sent to school, and was
taught in a purely elementary manner to be capable
of reading the New Testament, and this was all the
education his parents gave him, with the exception
of about a month’s schooling some long time afterwards
with the Rev. Mr. Alcock of Burnsal.</p>

<p>When about thirteen or fourteen, he joined his
father at Newby, till the death of Sir Edward
Blackett, and, his father having several books on
mathematics, and the boy being of a studious turn of
mind, he mastered their contents, and laid the
foundation of his future scholarship. When about
sixteen years of age, he went to London to be in the
counting-house of Mr. Christopher Blackett as bookkeeper;
but he had not been there more than a year
or two when he caught the small-pox, and, on his
recovery, went home into Yorkshire. His native air
soon restored him to health, and he studied hard at
poetry, history, and antiquities. He thus fitted himself
for keeping a school, which he opened in Netherdale,
and continued there for many years teaching
and studying. There he married, as he says, ‘unfortunately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
enough for me, for the misconduct of the
wife which that place afforded me has procured for
me this place, this prosecution, this infamy, and this
sentence.’</p>

<p>During these years he read the Latin and Greek
authors, and obtained such a name for scholarship
that he was invited to Knaresborough to keep a
school there. He removed thither in the year 1734,
and continued there until about six weeks after the
murder of Daniel Clark. In the meantime he had
mastered Hebrew, and when he went to London he
got a situation to teach Latin, and writing, at a school
in Piccadilly, kept by a Monsieur Painblanc, who not
only gave him a salary, but taught him French.
There he remained over two years, then went to Hays
as a writing-master, after which he wandered from
situation to situation, at one time earning his living
by copying for a law-stationer. At last, somehow, he
found himself an usher at the Free School at Lynn,
where he lived until he was arrested for the murder
of Daniel Clark.</p>

<p>This man was a shoemaker at Knaresborough, and
was an intimate visitor at Aram’s house&mdash;too intimate,
indeed, Aram thought, with his wife, hence the reference
to his wife previously quoted. He was a man
of bad character, and was more than suspected of
having, in company of another vagabond named
Houseman, murdered a Jew boy, who travelled the
country for one Levi as a pedlar, carrying a box containing
watches and jewellery. The poor lad was
decoyed to a place called Thistle Hill, where he was
robbed, murdered, and buried. This was about the
year 1744, and his bones were not found until 1758.</p>

<p>Richard Houseman, who was born the same year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
as Aram, was a near neighbour of the latter’s&mdash;in
fact, he lived next door, and his occupation was that
of a heckler of flax, when he gave out to the women
of the village to spin for him. But, according to his
own statement, he was a most unscrupulous black-guard.</p>

<p>Another intimate of Aram’s was a publican, named
Terry, but he only played a subsidiary part in the
drama, and nothing was ever brought home to him.</p>

<p>In January, 1745, Clark married a woman with a
small fortune of about two hundred pounds, and,
immediately afterwards, this little nest of rogues contrived
and carried out the following swindle. Clark,
as he was known to have married a woman of some
little money, was to obtain goods of any description
from whomsoever would part with them on credit;
these goods were to be deposited with, and hidden by,
Aram and Houseman, and, after plundering all that
was possible, Clark was to decamp, and leave his
young wife to do the best she could. This was the
scheme in which the noble and refined Eugene Aram
of Lord Lytton was to, and did, bear his full part.</p>

<p>Velvet from one man, leather from another, whips
from a third, table and bed linen from a fourth,
money lent by a fifth&mdash;all was fish that came to their
net; and, when obtained, they were hidden on the
premises either of Aram or Houseman, or else in a
place called St. Robert’s Cave, which was situated in
a field adjoining the Nid, a river near Knaresborough.
When this source was thoroughly exploited, a new
scheme was hit on by this ‘long firm.’ Clark should
pretend to be about to give a great wedding-feast,
and he went about gaily, borrowing silver tankards,
salvers, salts, spoons, &amp;c., from whoever would lend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
them. Indeed, so multifarious were his perquisitions,
that, according to one contemporary account, he got,
among other goods, the following: ‘three silver tankards,
four silver pints, one silver milk-pot, one ring
set with an emerald, and two brilliant diamonds,
another with three rose diamonds, a third with an
amethyst in the shape of a heart, and six plain rings,
eight watches, two snuff-boxes, Chambers’ Dictionary,
two vols. folio, Pope’s “Homer,” six vols., bound.’</p>

<p>Having got all that could be got, it was now high
time that Clark should disappear. He was last seen
on the early morning of the 8th February, 1745, and
from that time until August 1, 1758, nothing was
heard of him. He was supposed to have gone away
with all his booty&mdash;and yet not all of it, for suspicion
was aroused that both Aram and Houseman, from
their intimacy with Clark, were accomplices in his
frauds. And so it clearly proved, for, on Aram’s
house being searched, several articles were found the
produce of their joint roguery, and in his garden
were found buried, cambric and other goods, wrapped
in coarse canvas. Still, neither he, nor Houseman,
nor Terry were prosecuted,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> but Aram thought it
prudent to change his residence; so one fine day he
left his wife and family, and wandered forth. We
have seen the roving life he led, restless, and always
changing his abode; yet, during those thirteen years
of shifting exile, it must be said, to his credit, that no
breath of scandal attached to him; he was studious,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
somewhat morose, yet he was so liked by the boys
at the grammar-school at Lynn, that, when he was
taken thence by the officers of justice, they cried at
losing him.</p>

<p>Whilst at Lynn, he was recognised in June, 1758,
by a horse-dealer, and this recognition eventually
led to his apprehension; for, during that summer, a
labourer, digging for stone or gravel at a place called
Thistle Hill, near Knaresborough, found, at the depth
of two feet, a skeleton, which appeared to have been
buried doubled up. The remembrance of Clark’s
disappearance was at once awakened, and the body
was set down as being his.</p>

<p>A country town has a keen recollection of anything
which has occurred disturbing its equal pace, and
the connection of Aram and Houseman with Clark
was duly remembered. Aram was away, but Houseman
still lived among them, and he was ordered by
the coroner to attend the inquest. The principal
witness was Anna Aram, Eugene’s wife, and she had
frequently, since her husband’s departure, dropped
hints of her suspicion that Clark had been murdered.
Her evidence is clear. She said that Daniel Clark was
an intimate acquaintance of her husband’s, and that
they had frequent transactions together before the
8th of February, 1744-5, and that Richard Houseman
was often with them; particularly that, on the 7th
of February, 1744-5, about six o’clock in the evening,
Aram came home when she was washing in the
kitchen, upon which he directed her to put out the
fire, and make one above stairs; she accordingly did
so. About two o’clock in the morning of the 8th
of February, Aram, Clark, and Houseman came to
Aram’s house, and went upstairs to the room where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
she was. They stayed about an hour. Her husband
asked her for a handkerchief for Dickey (meaning
Richard Houseman) to tie about his head; she accordingly
lent him one. Then Clark said, ‘It will
soon be morning, and we must get off.’ After which
Aram, Houseman, and Clark all went out together;
that, upon Clark’s going out, she observed him take
a sack or wallet upon his back, which he carried
along with him; whither they went she could not
tell. That about five o’clock the same morning her
husband and Houseman returned, but Clark did not
come with them. Her husband came upstairs, and
desired to have a candle that he might make a fire
below. To which she objected, and said, ‘There
was no occasion for two fires, as there was a good
one in the room above, where she then was.’ To
which Aram, her husband, answered, ‘Dickey’ (meaning
Richard Houseman) ‘was below, and did not
choose to come upstairs.’ Upon which she asked
(Clark not returning with them), ‘What had they
done with Daniel?’ To this her husband gave her
no answer, but desired her to go to bed, which she
refused to do, and told him, ‘They had been doing
something bad.’ Then Aram went down with the candle.</p>

<p>She, being desirous to know what her husband and
Houseman were doing, and being about to go downstairs,
she heard Houseman say to Aram,</p>

<p>‘She is coming.’</p>

<p>Her husband replied, ‘We’ll not let her.’</p>

<p>Houseman then said, ‘If she does, she’ll tell.’</p>

<p>‘What can she tell?’ replied Aram. ‘Poor simple
thing! she knows nothing.’</p>

<p>To which Houseman said, ‘If she tells that I am
here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> ‘twill be enough.’
</p>

<p>Her husband then said, ‘I will hold the door to
prevent her from coming.’</p>

<p>Whereupon Houseman said, ‘Something must be
done to prevent her telling,’ and pressed him to it
very much, and said, ‘If she does not tell now, she
may at some other time.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said her husband, ‘we will coax her a little
until her passion be off, and then take an opportunity
to shoot her.’</p>

<p>Upon which Houseman appeared satisfied and said,
‘What must be done with her clothes?’ Whereupon
they both agreed that they would let her lie where
she was shot in her clothes.</p>

<p>She, hearing this discourse, was much terrified,
but remained quiet, until near seven o’clock in the
same morning, when Aram and Houseman went out
of the house. Upon which Mrs. Aram, coming
down-stairs, and seeing there had been a fire below
and all the ashes taken out of the grate, she went and
examined the dung-hill; and, perceiving ashes of a
different kind to lie upon it, she searched amongst
them, and found several pieces of linen and woollen
cloth, very near burnt, which had the appearance of
belonging to wearing apparel. When she returned
into the house from the dung-hill, she found the
handkerchief she had lent Houseman the night
before; and, looking at it, she found some blood upon
it, about the size of a shilling. Upon which she
immediately went to Houseman, and showed him the
pieces of cloth she had found, and said ‘she was
afraid they had done something bad to Clark.’ But
Houseman then pretended he was a stranger to her
accusation, and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> ‘he knew nothing what she
meant.’
</p>

<p>From the above circumstances she believed Daniel
Clark to have been murdered by Richard Houseman
and Eugene Aram, on the 8th of February, 1744-5.</p>

<p>Several witnesses gave evidence that the last persons
seen with Clark were Aram and Houseman,
and two surgeons gave it as their opinion that the
body might have lain in the ground about thirteen or
fourteen years.</p>

<p>During the inquiry Houseman seemed very uneasy:
he trembled, turned pale, and faltered in his speech;
and when, at the instigation of the coroner, in accordance
with the superstitious practice of the time,
he went to touch the bones, he was very averse so
to do. At last he mustered up courage enough to
take up one of the bones in his hand; but, immediately
throwing it down again, he exclaimed: ‘This
is no more Dan Clark’s bone than it is mine!’ He
further said he could produce a witness who had
seen Clark after the 8th of February; and he called
on Parkinson, who deposed that, personally, he had
not seen Clark after that time, but a friend of his
(Parkinson’s) had told him that he had met a person
like Daniel Clark, but as it was a snowy day, and the
person had the cape of his great-coat up, he could
not say with the least degree of certainty who he was.</p>

<p>Of course, this witness did not help Houseman a
bit, and then the suspicion increased that he was
either the principal, or an accomplice in Clark’s
murder. Application was made to a magistrate,
who granted a warrant for his apprehension. At his
examination he made a statement, which he would
not sign, saying, ‘He chose to waive it for the present;
for he might have something to add, and therefore
desired to have time to consider of it.’ This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
confirmed former suspicions, and he was committed
to York Castle.</p>

<p>On his way thither he was very uneasy, and, hearing
that the magistrate who committed him was at
that time in York, he asked him to be sent for, and
he made the following statement:</p>

<h3><i>The examination of Richard Houseman, of Knaresbrough,
flax-dresser.</i></h3>

<p>‘This examinant saies that true it is that Daniel
Clark was murdered by Eugene Aram, late of
Knaresbrough, schoolmaster, and, as he believes,
it was on Friday morning, the 8th of February, 1744,
as set forth by other informations, as to matter of
time; for that he, and Eugene Aram and Daniel
Clark were together at Aram’s house early in the
morning, when there was snow on the ground, and
moonlight, and went out of Aram’s house a little
before them, and went up the street a little before
them, and they called to him to go a little way with
them; and he accordingly went with them to a
place called St. Robert’s Cave, near Grimble Bridge,
where Aram and Clark stopt a little; and then he
saw Aram strike him several times over the breast
and head, and saw him fall, as if he was dead, and
he, the examinant, came away and left them together,
but whether Aram used any weapon or not to kill
him with, he can’t tell, nor does he know what he
did with the body afterwards, but believes Aram
left it at the Cave’s mouth; for this examinant,
seeing Aram do this, to which, he declares, he was
no way abetting, or privy to, nor knew of his design
to kill him at all. This made the examinant make
the best of his way from him, lest he might share
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the same fate; and got to the bridge-end, and then
lookt back, and saw him coming from the Caveside,
which is in a private rock adjoining the river;
and he could discern some bundle in his hand, but
does not know what it was. On which he, this
informant, made the best of his way to the town,
without joining Aram again, or seeing him again
till the next day, and from that time to this, he
has never had any private discourse with him.’</p>

<p>After signing this statement, Houseman said that
Clark’s body would be found in St. Robert’s Cave,
in the turn at the entrance of the cave, its head
lying to the right; and, sure enough, in the spot
described, and in that position, was a skeleton found,
with two holes in its skull, made apparently with a
pickaxe or hammer.</p>

<p>A warrant was at once issued for the apprehension
of Aram, and duly executed at Lynn. When first
questioned, he denied ever having been at Knaresborough,
or that he had ever known Daniel Clark;
but when he was confronted with the constable from
Knaresborough, he was obliged to retract his words.
On the journey to York, Aram was restless, inquiring
after his old neighbours, and what they said of him.
He was told that they were much enraged against
him for the loss of their goods. Whereupon he asked
if it would not be possible to make up the matter?
and the answer was, perhaps it might be, if he
restored what they had lost. He then said that was
impossible, but he might, perhaps, find them an
equivalent.</p>

<p>On his arrival at York, he was taken before a
magistrate, to whom he made a statement, which
was a parcel of lies. He was committed to York
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Castle, but had not gone more than a mile on his
way thither when he wished to return and make a
second statement, which was as follows:</p>

<p>‘That he was at his own house on the 7th of
February, 1744-5, at night, when Richard Houseman
and Daniel Clark came to him with some plate; and
both of them went for more, several times, and came
back with several pieces of plate, of which Clark
was endeavouring to defraud his neighbours; that
he could not but observe that Houseman was all
night very diligent to assist him to the utmost of
his power, and insisted that this was Houseman’s
business that night, and not the signing any note
or instrument, as is pretended by Houseman; that
Henry Terry, then of Knaresborough, ale-keeper,
was as much concerned in abetting the said frauds
as either Houseman or Clark; but was not now at
Aram’s house, because as it was market-day&mdash;his absence
from his guests might have occasioned some
suspicion; that Terry, notwithstanding, brought two
silver tankards that night, upon Clark’s account,
which had been fraudulently obtained; and that
Clark, so far from having borrowed twenty pounds
of Houseman, to his knowledge never borrowed
more than nine pounds, which he paid again before
that night.</p>

<p>‘That all the leather Clark had&mdash;which amounted
to a considerable value&mdash;he well knows was concealed
under flax in Houseman’s house, with intent
to be disposed of by little and little, in order to
prevent suspicion of his being concerned in Clark’s
fraudulent practices.</p>

<p>‘That Terry took the plate in a bag, as Clark
and Houseman did the watches, rings, and several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
small things of value, and carried them into the
flat, where they and he’ (Aram) ‘went together to
St. Robert’s Cave, and beat most of the plate flat.
It was thought too late in the morning, being about
four o’clock, on the 8th of February, 1744-5, for
Clark to go off, so as to get to any distance; it
was therefore agreed he should stay there till the
night following, and Clark, accordingly, stayed there
all that day, as he believes, they having agreed to
send him victuals, which were carried to him by
Henry Terry, he being judged the most likely person
to do it without suspicion; for, as he was a shooter,
he might go thither under the pretence of sporting;
that the next night, in order to give Clark more
time to get off, Henry Terry, Richard Houseman,
and himself went down to the cave very early;
but he’ (Aram) ‘did not go in, or see Clark at all;
that Richard Houseman and Henry Terry only went
into the cave, he staying to watch at a little distance
on the outside, lest anybody should surprise them.</p>

<p>‘That he believes they were beating some plate,
for he heard them make a noise. They stayed there
about an hour, and then came out of the cave, and
told him that Clark was gone off. Observing a bag
they had along with them, he took it in his hand,
and saw that it contained plate. On asking why
Daniel did not take the plate along with him, Terry
and Houseman replied that they had bought it of
him, as well as the watches, and had given him
money for it, that being more convenient for him
to go off with, as less cumbersome and dangerous.
After which they all three went into Houseman’s
warehouse, and concealed the watches, with the
small plate, there; but that Terry carried away with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
him the great plate; that, afterwards, Terry told
him he carried it to How Hill, and hid it there, and
then went into Scotland and disposed of it; but
as to Clark, he could not tell whether he was murdered
or not, he knew nothing of him, only they
told him he was gone off.’</p>

<p>Terry, being thus implicated, was arrested and
committed to gaol; but the prosecutors for the crown,
after the bills of indictment were preferred against
all three, finding their proof insufficient to obtain a
conviction at the coming assizes, prevailed on the
judge to hold the case over until the Lammas
Assizes. There was not enough outside evidence to
convict them all; evidence, if any, could only be
furnished by the criminals themselves. There was
sufficient to convict either Aram or Houseman singly,
if one or other would tell the truth, and all he knew;
so after many consultations as to the person whom it
was most advisable and just to punish, it was
unanimously agreed that Aram, who from his education
and position was the worst of the lot, should be
punished, and in order to do so it was necessary to
try to acquit Houseman, who would then be available
as evidence against Aram. The case against Terry
was so slight, that he was, perforce, let go.</p>

<p>On Friday, 3rd of August, 1759, the trials took
place, and Houseman was first arraigned, but there
being no evidence against him he was acquitted, to
the great surprise and regret of everyone who was
not behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Then Aram was put in the dock to stand his trial,
and deep, indeed, must have been his disgust, when
he found his accomplice, Houseman, step into the
witness-box and tell his version (undoubtedly perjured)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
of the murder. His evidence was, except in a
few minor particulars, similar to his previous statement.
Sweet innocent! When he saw Aram strike
Clark, he made haste home, and knew nothing of the
disposal of the body until the next morning, when
Aram called on him, and told him he had left it in the
cave, and dire were his threats of vengeance should
Houseman ever disclose the dread secret of that
eventful night.</p>

<p>After this sensational evidence the other witnesses
must have seemed very tame. Clark’s servant proved
that his master had just received his wife’s little
portion, and that Aram was perfectly cognizant
thereof. Another witness deposed to seeing Houseman
come out of Aram’s house about one o’clock in
the morning of the 8th of February. A third deposed
to the recovery of some of his own goods of which
Clark had defrauded him, and which were found
buried in Aram’s garden. The constable who arrested
him had a few words to say, and the skull was
produced in Court, when a surgical expert declared
that the fractures must have been produced by blows
from some blunt instrument, and could not possibly
proceed from natural decay.</p>

<p>Aram was then called upon for his defence, and he
produced a manuscript of which the following is a
copy. It is, as will be perceived, a laboured and
casuistical defence, not having a true ring about it,
and not at all like the utterance of a perfectly innocent
man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I know not whether it is of right or
through some indulgence of your Lordship that I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
allowed the liberty at this Bar and at this time to
attempt a defence, incapable, and uninstructed as I
am to speak. Since, while I see so many eyes upon
me, so numerous and awful a concourse, fixed with
attention, and filled with I know not what expectancy,
I labour, not with guilt, my Lord, but with perplexity.
For having never seen a Court but this, being
wholly unacquainted with law, the customs of the
Bar, and all judiciary proceedings, I fear I shall be
so little capable of speaking with propriety in this
place, that it exceeds my hope, if I shall be able to
speak at all.</p>

<p>I have heard, my Lord, the indictment read,
wherein I find myself charged with the highest
crime, with an enormity I am altogether incapable
of, a fact to the commission of which there goes far
more insensibility of heart, more profligacy of morals,
than ever fell to my lot. And nothing, possibly, could
have admitted a presumption of this nature, but a
depravity not inferior to that imputed to me. However,
as I stand indicted at your Lordship’s Bar, and
have heard what is called evidence induced in support
of such a charge, I very humbly solicit your
Lordship’s patience, and beg the hearing of this
respectable audience, while I, single and unskilful,
destitute of friends, and unassisted by counsel, say
something, perhaps like an argument, in my defence.
I shall consume but little of your Lordship’s time;
what I have to say will be short, and this brevity,
probably, will be the best part of it. However, it is
offered with all possible regard, and the greatest submission
to your Lordship’s consideration, and that of
this honourable Court.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> My Lord, the whole tenor of my conduct in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
life contradicts every particular of this indictment.
Yet I had never said this, did not my present circumstances
extort it from me, and seem to make it
necessary. Permit me here, my Lord, to call upon
malignity itself, so long and cruelly busied in this
prosecution, to charge upon me any immorality, of
which prejudice was not the author. No, my Lord, I
concerted not schemes of fraud, projected no violence,
injured no man’s person or property. My days
were honestly laborious, my nights intensely studious.
And I humbly conceive my notice of this, especially
at this time, will not be thought impertinent or unreasonable,
but, at least, deserving some attention.
Because, my Lord, that any person, after a temperate
use of life, a series of thinking and acting regularly,
and without one single deviation from sobriety,
should plunge into the very depth of profligacy, precipitately,
and at once, is altogether improbable and
unprecedented, and absolutely inconsistent with the
course of things. Mankind is never corrupted at
once; villainy is always progressive, and declines
from right, step after step, till every regard of probity
is lost, and all moral obligation totally perishes.</p>

<p>Again, my Lord, a suspicion of this kind, which
nothing but malevolence could entertain, and ignorance
propagate, is violently opposed by my very
situation at that time, with respect to health. For,
but a little space before, I had been confined to my
bed, and suffered under a very long and severe disorder,
and was not able, for half a year together, so
much as to walk. The distemper left me, indeed,
yet slowly, and in part; but so macerated, so enfeebled,
that I was reduced to crutches, and was so
far from being well about the time I am charged with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
this fact, that I never to this day perfectly recovered.
Could, then, a person in this condition take anything
into his head so unlikely, so extravagant? I, past
the vigour of my age, feeble and valetudinary, with
no inducement to engage, no ability to accomplish,
no weapon wherewith to perpetrate such a fact;
without interest, without power, without motive,
without means.</p>

<p>Besides, it must needs occur to everyone that an
action of this atrocious nature is never heard of, but,
when its springs are laid open, it appears that it was
to support some indolence or supply some luxury, to
satisfy some avarice or oblige some malice, to prevent
some real, or some imaginary want; yet I lay
not under the influence of any one of these. Surely,
my Lord, I may, consistent with both truth and
modesty, affirm thus much; and none who have any
veracity, and knew me, will ever question this.</p>

<p>In the second plea, the disappearance of Clark is
suggested as an argument of his being dead; but the
uncertainty of such an inference from that, and the
fallibility of all conclusions of such a sort, from such
a circumstance, are too obvious and too notorious
to require instances; yet, superseding many, permit
me to produce a very recent one, and that afforded
by this castle.</p>

<p>In June, 1757, William Thompson, for all the
vigilance of this place, in open daylight, and double-ironed,
made his escape, and, notwithstanding an
immediate inquiry set on foot, the strictest search,
and all advertisements, was never seen or heard of
since. If, then, Thompson got off unseen, through
all these difficulties, how very easy was it for Clark,
when none of them opposed him? But what would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
be thought of a prosecution commenced against any
one seen last with Thompson?</p>

<p>Permit me next, my Lord, to observe a little upon
the bones which have been discovered. It is said,
which, perhaps, is saying very far, that these are the
skeleton of a man. It is possible, indeed it may; but
is there any certain known criterion which incontestably
distinguishes the sex in human bones? Let
it be considered, my Lord, whether the ascertaining
of this point ought not to precede any attempt to
identify them.</p>

<p>The place of their deposition, too, claims much
more attention than is commonly bestowed upon it.
For, of all places in the world, none could have mentioned
anyone wherein there was greater certainty
of finding human bones than an hermitage, except
he should point out a churchyard. Hermitages, in
times past, being not only places of religious retirement,
but of burial, too, and it has scarce or never
been heard of, but that every cell now known, contains,
or contained, these relics of humanity, some
mutilated and some entire. I do not inform, but
give me leave to remind, your Lordship, that here
sat solitary sanctity, and here the hermit, or the
anchoress, hoped that repose for their bones, when
dead, they here enjoyed when living.</p>

<p>All this while, my Lord, I am sensible this is known
to your Lordship, and many in this Court, better than
I. But it seems necessary to my case, that others,
who have not at all, perhaps, adverted to things of
this nature, and may have concern in my trial, should
be made acquainted with it. Suffer me, then, my
Lord, to produce a few of many evidences that these
cells were used as repositories of the dead, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
enumerate a few, in which human bones have been
found, as it happened in this in question, lest, to some,
that accident might seem extraordinary, and, consequently,
occasion prejudice.</p>

<p>1. The bones, as was supposed, of the Saxon, St.
Dubritius, were discovered buried in his cell at
Guy’s Cliff near Warwick, as appears from the
authority of Sir William Dugdale.</p>

<p>2. The bones, thought to be those of the anchoress
Rosia, were but lately discovered in a cell at Royston,
entire, fair, and undecayed, though they must
have lain interred for several centuries, as is proved
by Dr. Stukeley.</p>

<p>3. But our own country, nay, almost this neighbourhood,
supplies another instance; for in January,
1747, was found by Mr. Stovin, accompanied by a
reverend gentleman, the bones in part of some
recluse, in the cell at Lindholm, near Hatfield. They
were believed to be those of William of Lindholm,
a hermit, who had long made this cave his habitation.</p>

<p>4. In February, 1744, part of Woburn Abbey being
pulled down, a large portion of a corpse appeared,
even with the flesh on, and which bore cutting with
a knife, though it is certain this had lain above two
hundred years, and how much longer is doubtful,
for this abbey was founded in 1145, and dissolved in
1558 or 1559.</p>

<p>What would have been said, what believed, if this
had been an accident to the bones in question?</p>

<p>Further, my Lord, it is not yet out of living memory
that a little distance from Knaresborough, in a field,
part of the manor of the worthy and patriotic baronet
who does that borough the honour to represent it in
Parliament, were found, in digging for gravel, not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
one human skeleton alone, but five or six, deposited
side by side, with each an urn placed at its head, as
your Lordship knows was usual in ancient interments.</p>

<p>About the same time, and in another field, almost
close to this borough, was discovered also, in searching
for gravel, another human skeleton; but the
piety of the same worthy gentleman ordered both
pits to be filled up again, commendably unwilling to
disturb the dead.</p>

<p>Is the invention<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> of these bones forgotten, then, or
industriously concealed, that the discovery of those
in question may appear the more singular and extraordinary?
whereas, in fact, there is nothing extraordinary
in it. My Lord, almost every place conceals
such remains. In fields, in hills, in highway sides,
and in commons lie frequent and unsuspected bones.
And our present allotments for rest for the departed,
is but of some centuries.</p>

<p>Another particular seems not to claim a little of
your Lordship’s notice, and that of the gentlemen of
the jury; which is, that perhaps no example occurs
of more than <i>one</i> skeleton being found in <i>one</i> cell, and
in the cell in question was found but <i>one</i>; agreeable,
in this, to the peculiarity of every other known cell
in Britain. Not the invention of one skeleton, then,
but of two, would have appeared suspicious and
uncommon.</p>

<p>But then, my Lord, to attempt to identify these,
when even to identify living men sometimes has
proved so difficult&mdash;as in the case of Perkin Warbeck
and Lambert Symnel at home, and of Don Sebastian
abroad&mdash;will be looked upon, perhaps, as an attempt
to determine what is indeterminable. And I hope,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
too, it will not pass unconsidered here, where gentlemen
believe with caution, think with reason, and
decide with humanity, what interest the endeavour
to do this is calculated to serve, in assigning proper
personality to those bones, whose particular appropriation
can only appear to eternal omniscience.</p>

<p>Permit me, my Lord, also, very humbly to remonstrate
that, as human bones appear to have been the
inseparable adjuncts of every cell, even any person’s
naming such a place at random as containing them,
in this case, shows him rather unfortunate, than conscious
prescient, and that these attendants on every
hermitage only accidentally concurred with this conjecture.
A mere casual coincidence of <i>words</i> and <i>things</i>.</p>

<p>But it seems another skeleton has been discovered
by some labourer, which was full as confidently
averred to be Clark’s as this. My Lord, must some of
the living, if it promotes some interest, be made
answerable for all the bones that earth has concealed,
and chance exposed! and might not a place where
bones lay, be mentioned by a person by chance, as
well as found by a labourer by chance? Or, is it more
criminal accidentally to <i>name</i> where bones lie, than
accidentally to <i>find</i> where they lie?</p>

<p>Here, too, is a human skull produced, which is
fractured; but was this the <i>cause</i> or was it the consequence
of death&mdash;was it owing to violence, or was it
the effect of natural decay? If it was violence, was
that violence before or after death? My Lord, in May,
1732, the remains of William, Lord Archbishop of this
province, were taken up by permission, in this cathedral,
and the bones of the skull were found broken;
yet certainly he died by no violence offered to him
alive, that could occasion that fracture there.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>Let it be considered, my Lord, that upon the dissolution
of religious houses, and the commencement of the
Reformation, the ravages of those times affected the
living and the dead. In search after imaginary
treasures, coffins were broken up, graves and vaults
broken open, monuments ransacked, and shrines demolished;
your Lordship knows that these violations
proceeded so far, as to occasion parliamentary authority
to restrain them; and it did, about the beginning
of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. I entreat your
Lordship, suffer not the violence, the depredations,
and the iniquities of these times to be imputed to
this.</p>

<p>Moreover, what gentleman here is ignorant that
Knaresborough had a castle, which, though How a
ruin, was once considerable, both for its strength and
garrison. All know it was vigorously besieged by
the arms of the Parliament. At which siege, in sallies,
conflicts, flights, pursuits, many fell in all the places
around it; and where they fell were buried. For
every place, my Lord, is burial-earth in war; and
many, questionless, of these yet rest unknown, whose
bones futurity shall discover.</p>

<p>I hope, with all imaginable submission, that what
has been said will not be thought impertinent to this
indictment, and that it will be far from the wisdom,
the learning, and the integrity of this place to impute
to the living what zeal, in its fury, may have done;
what nature may have taken off, and piety interred;
or what war alone may have destroyed, alone
deposited.</p>

<p>As to the circumstances that have been raked together,
I have nothing to observe; but that all circumstances
whatsoever are precarious, and have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
but too frequently found lamentably fallible; even the
strongest have failed. They may rise to the utmost
degree of probability, yet they are but probability
still. Why should I name to your Lordship the two
Harrisons, recorded in Dr. Howel, who both suffered
upon circumstances, because of the sudden disappearance
of their lodger, who was in credit, had
contracted debts, borrowed money, and went off
unseen, and returned again a great many years after
their execution. Why name the intricate affair of
Jaques du Moulin under King Charles II., related by
a gentleman who was counsel for the Crown. And
why the unhappy Coleman, who suffered innocent,
though convicted upon positive evidence, and whose
children perished for want, because the world uncharitably
believed the father guilty. Why mention
the perjury of Smith, incautiously admitted king’s
evidence; who, to screen himself, equally accused
Fainlotte and Loveday of the murder of Dunn; the
first of whom, in 1749, was executed at Winchester;
and Loveday was about to suffer at Reading, had not
Smith been proved perjured, to the satisfaction of the
court, by the surgeon of Gosport Hospital.</p>

<p>Now, my Lord, having endeavoured to show that
the whole of this process is altogether repugnant to
every part of my life; that it is inconsistent with my
condition of health about that time; that no rational
inference can be drawn that a person is dead who
suddenly disappears; that hermitages were the constant
repositories of the bones of the recluse; that
the proofs of this are well authenticated; that the
revolution in religion, or the fortunes of war, has
mangled, or buried, the dead; the conclusion remains,
perhaps no less reasonably, than impatiently,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
wished for. I, last, after a year’s confinement, equal
to either fortune, put myself upon the candour, the
justice, and the humanity of your Lordship, and upon
yours, my countrymen, gentlemen of the jury.’</p>

<p>It will be seen from this elaborate defence that it
must have been written long before his trial, and before
his hopes of acquittal were crushed by the
appearance of Houseman in the witness-box to give
evidence against him; for he did not attempt to discredit
his evidence, nor did he attempt to shake
his testimony by cross-examination, and he must
have anticipated the result. The judge summed
up carefully; he recapitulated the evidence, and
showed how Houseman’s testimony was confirmed by
the other witnesses; and, taking Aram’s defence, he
pointed out that he had alleged nothing that could
invalidate the positive evidence against him. The
jury, without leaving the court, returned a verdict
of ‘Guilty,’ and the judge pronounced the awful
sentence of the law. Aram had behaved with great
firmness and dignity during the whole of his trial, and
he heard his conviction, and his doom, with profound
composure, leaving the bar with a smile upon his
countenance.</p>

<p>In those days the law allowed but little time for
appeal. Aram was tried, convicted, and sentenced on
Friday, the 3rd of August, 1759, and he had to die
on the following Monday&mdash;only two whole days of
life being allowed him. Those days must have been
days of exquisite torture to him, when he thought
of the upturned faces of the mob, all fixing their gaze
upon him, yelling at, and execrating him, and we can
scarcely wonder at his attempting to commit suicide.
On the Monday morning, when the clergyman came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
to visit him, and at his request to administer the
Sacrament to him, he was astonished to find Aram
stretched on the floor of his cell in a pool of blood.
He had managed to secrete a razor, and had cut the
veins of his arms in two places. Surgeons were
sent for, and they brought him back to life, when he
was put into the cart and led to execution. Arrived
at the gallows, he was asked if he had any speech to
make, and he replied in the negative. He was then
hanged, and, when dead, his body was cut down,
put in a cart, taken to Knaresborough, and there
suspended in chains, on a gibbet which was erected
on Knaresborough forest, south or south-east of the
Low Bridge, on the right hand side going thence to
Plumpton. It was taken down in 1778, when the
forest was enclosed.</p>

<p>He left his latest thoughts in writing, for, on the
table in his cell, was found a paper on which was
written,</p>

<p>‘What am I better than my fathers? To die is
natural and necessary. Perfectly sensible of this,
I fear no more to die than I did to be born. But the
manner of it is something which should, in my
opinion, be decent and manly. I think I have regarded
both these points. Certainly nobody has a
better right to dispose of man’s life than himself; and
he, not others, should determine how. As for any
indignities offered to anybody, or silly reflections on
my faith and morals, they are (as they were) things
indifferent to me. I think, though, contrary to the
common way of thinking; I wrong no man by this,
and I hope it is not offensive to that eternal being
who formed me and the world; and as by this I
injure no man, no man can be reasonably offended.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
I solicitously recommend myself to the eternal and
almighty Being, the God of Nature, if I have done
amiss. But perhaps I have not, and I hope this
thing will never be imputed to me. Though I am
now stained by malevolence, and suffer by prejudice,
I hope to rise fair and unblemished. My life was not
polluted, my morals irreproachable, and my opinions
orthodox.</p>

<p>‘I slept soundly till three o’clock, awak’d, and then
writ these lines.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘“Come, pleasing Rest, eternal Slumber fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seal mine, that once must seal the eyes of all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm and compos’d my soul her journey takes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No guilt that troubles, and no heart that aches.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu! thou sun, all bright like her arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu! fair friends, and all that’s good and wise.”’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Aram never made any regular confession of his
guilt&mdash;but in a letter he wrote to the vicar of
Knaresborough, in which he gives his autobiography,
he says, ‘Something is expected as to the affair
upon which I was committed, to which I say, as
I mentioned in my examination, that all the plate
of Knaresborough, except the watches and rings,
were in Houseman’s possession; as for me, I had
nothing at all. My wife knows that Terry had the
large plate, and that Houseman himself took both
that and the watches, at my house, from Clark’s
own hands; and, if she will not give this in evidence
for the town, she wrongs both that and her own
conscience; and, if it is not done soon, Houseman
will prevent her. She likewise knows that Terry’s
wife had some velvet, and, if she will, can testify
it. She deserves not the regard of the town, if she
will not. That part of Houseman’s evidence, wherein
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
he said I threatened him, was absolutely false; for
what hindered him, when I was so long absent and
far distant? I must need observe another thing to
be perjury in Houseman’s evidence, in which he
said he went home from Clark; whereas he went
straight to my house, as my wife can also testify, if
I be not believed.’</p>

<p>The contemporary accounts of his trial, whether
published in York or London, have the following:</p>

<p>‘Aram’s sentence was a just one, and he submitted
to it with that stoicism he so much affected;
and the morning after he was condemned, he confessed
the justness of it to two clergymen (who had
a licence from the judge to attend him), by declaring
that he murdered Clark. Being asked by one of
them what his motive was for doing that abominable
action, he told them, ‘he suspected Clark of having
an unlawful commerce with his wife; that he was
persuaded at the time, when he committed the murder,
he did right, but, since, he had thought it wrong.’</p>

<p>‘After this, pray,’ said Aram, ‘what became of
Clark’s body, if Houseman went home (as he said
upon my trial) immediately on seeing him fall?’</p>

<p>One of the clergymen replied, ‘I’ll tell you what
became of it. You and Houseman dragged it into
the cave, stripped and buried it there; brought away
his clothes, and burnt them at your own house.’</p>

<p>To which he assented. He was asked whether
Houseman did not earnestly press him to murder
his wife, for fear she should discover the business
they had been about. He hastily replied,</p>

<p>‘He did, and pressed me several times to do it.’</p>

<p>Aram’s wife lived some years after his execution;
indeed, she did not die until 1774. She lived in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
small house near Low Bridge, within sight of her
husband’s gibbet; and here she sold pies, sausages,
&amp;c. It is said that she used to search under the
gibbet for any of her husband’s bones that might
have fallen, and then bury them.</p>

<p>Aram, by his wife, had six children, who survived
their childhood&mdash;three sons and three daughters.
All these children, save one, Sally, took after their
mother; but Sally resembled her father, both physically
and mentally. She was well read in the classics,
and Aram would sometimes put his scholars to the
blush, by having Sally in their class. Her father
was very fond of her, and she was living with him
at Lynn when he was arrested, and she clung to
him when in prison at York. On his death, she went
to London, and, after a time, she married, and, with
her husband, kept a public-house on the Surrey side
of Westminster Bridge.</p>

<p>Houseman went back to Knaresborough, where he
abode until his death. He was naturally mobbed,
and never dared stir out in the day time, but sometimes
slunk out at night. Despised and detested by
all, his life must have been a burden to him, and his
punishment in this world far heavier than Aram was
called upon to bear.

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Slavery</span>, properly so called, appears to
have been from the earliest ages, and in
almost every country, the condition of
a large portion of the human race; the
weakest had ever to serve the strong&mdash;whether
the slave was a captive in battle, or an impecunious
debtor unable to satisfy the claims of his creditor,
save with his body. Climate made no difference.
Slavery existed in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in
our own ‘right little, tight little island,’ our early
annals show that a large proportion of the Anglo-Saxon
population was in a state of slavery. These
unfortunate bondsmen, who were called theows,
thrœls, and esnes,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> were bought and sold with land,
and were classed in the inventory of their lord’s
wealth, with his sheep, swine, and oxen, and were
bequeathed by will, precisely as we now dispose of
our money, or furniture.</p>

<p>The condition of the Anglo-Saxon slaves was very
degraded indeed; their master might put them in
bonds, might whip them, nay, might even brand
them, like cattle, with his own distinguishing mark, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
state of things which existed until Alfred the Great
enacted some laws, whereby the time of the servitude
of these unhappy people was limited to six years,
and the institution of slavery received such a blow,
that it speedily became a thing of the past. They
were no longer slaves, but redemptioners, <i>i.e.</i>, they
had the hope of redemption from servitude, and the
law gave them the power to enforce their freedom.</p>

<p>We have only to turn to the pages of holy writ to
find slavery flourishing in rank luxuriance in the
time of the patriarchs, and before the birth of Moses.
Euphemistically described in Scripture history as
servants, they were mostly unconditional and perpetual
slaves. They were strangers, either taken
prisoners in war or purchased from the neighbouring
nations; but the Jews also had a class of servants
who only were in compulsory bondage for a limited
time, and they were men of their own nation.</p>

<p>These were men who, by reason of their poverty,
were obliged to give their bodies in exchange for the
wherewithal to support them, or they were insolvent
debtors, and thus sought to liquidate their indebtedness,
or men who had committed a theft, and had not
the means of making the double, or fourfold, restitution
that the law required. Their thraldom was not
perpetual, they might be redeemed, and, if not redeemed,
they became free on the completion of their
seventh year of servitude.</p>

<p>Exodus, chap. 21, vv. 2-6. ‘If thou buy an
Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve: and in the
seventh he shall go out free for nothing. If he came
in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he were
married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his
master have given him a wife, and she have borne
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
him sons or daughters, the wife and her children
shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master,
my wife, and my children: I will not go out free:
then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he
shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door-post;
and his master shall bore his ear through with
an awl, and he shall serve for ever.’</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a redemptioner, one whose
servitude was not a hopeless one, and we find this
limited bondage again referred to in Leviticus, chap.
25, vv. 39, 40, 41.</p>

<p>‘And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen
poor, and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not compel
him to serve as a bond servant: but as an hired servant,
and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and
shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee. And then
shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
with him, and shall return unto his own family, and
unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.’</p>

<p>Here in England we are accustomed to look upon
the slave from one point of view only, as an unhappy
being of a different race and colour to ourselves, few
of us knowing that there has been a time (and that
not so very long ago) when members of our own
nation, so utterly forlorn and miserable from the rude
buffetings Fortune had given them in their way
through the world, have been glad to sell their bodies
for a time, to enable them to commence afresh the
struggle for existence, in another land, and, perchance,
under more favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>In ‘his Majesty’s plantations’ of Virginia, Maryland,
and New England, and in the West Indies,
these unfortunates were first called servants, and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
such are officially described; but in America in later
times they received the appellation of redemptioners,
a name by which they were certainly called in the
middle of this century, for in Dorsey’s ‘Laws of
Maryland,’ published in 1840, we find an Act<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> (cap.
226) was passed in 1817 to alleviate the condition of
these poor people. The preamble sets forth, ‘Whereas
it has been found that German and Swiss emigrants,
who for the discharge of the debt contracted for
their passage to this country are often obliged to
subject themselves to temporary servitude, are
frequently exposed to cruel and oppressive impositions
by the masters of the vessels in which they
arrive, and likewise by those to whom they become
servants,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is impossible to fix any date when this iniquitous
traffic first began. It arose, probably, from the want
of labourers in the plantations of our colonies in their
early days, and the employment of unscrupulous
agents on this side to supply their needs in this
respect. A man in pecuniary difficulties in the seventeenth
and eighteen centuries was indeed in woeful
plight: a gaol was his certain destination, and there
he might rot his life away, cut off from all hope of
release, unless death came mercifully to his relief.
All knew of the horrors of a debtor’s prison, and, to
escape them, an able-bodied man had recourse to the
dreadful expedient of selling himself into bondage,
for a term of years, in one of the plantations, either in
America or the West Indies, or he would believe the
specious tales of the ‘kidnappers,’ as they were called,
who would promise anything, a free passage, and a
glorious life of ease and prosperity in a new land.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>Thoroughly broken down, wretched, and miserable,
his thoughts would naturally turn towards a new
country, wherein he might rehabilitate himself, and, in
an evil hour, he would apply to some (as we should
term it) emigration agent, who would even kindly
advance him a trifle for an outfit. The voyage out
would be an unhappy experience, as the emigrants
would be huddled together, with scant food, and, on
his arrival at his destination, he would early discover
the further miseries in store for him; for, immediately
on landing, or even before he left the ship, his body
would be seized as security for passage money, which
had, in all probability, been promised him free, and
for money lent for his outfit; and, having no means
of paying either, utterly friendless, and in a strange
country, he would be sold to slavery for a term of
years to some planter who would pay the debt for
him.</p>

<p>Having obtained his flesh and blood at such a
cheap rate, his owner would not part with him
lightly, and it was an easy thing to arrange matters
so that he was always kept in debt for clothes and
tobacco, &amp;c., in order that he never should free himself.
It was a far cry to England, and with no one
to help him, or to draw public attention to his case,
the poor wretch had to linger until death mercifully
released him from his bondage; his condition being
truly deplorable, as he would be under the same
regulations as the convicts, and one may be very
sure that <i>their</i> lot was not enviable in those harsh
and merciless times. It was not for many years,
until the beginning of this century, that the American
laws took a beneficial turn in favour of these
unhappy people; and it was then too late, for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
institution of redemptioners died a speedy death,
owing to the influx of free emigration.</p>

<p>One of the earliest notices of these unfortunates is
in a collection of Old Black letter ballads, in the
British Museum, where there is one entitled, ‘The
Trappan’d Maiden, or the Distressed Damsel,’
(c. 22, e. 2)/186 in which are depicted some of the sorrows
which were undergone by these unwilling emigrants,
at that time. The date, as nearly as can be assigned
to it, is about 1670.</p>

<p>Some of these complaints would seem to us to be
rather of the ‘crumpled rose-leaf’ order, but probably
there was enough humanity left in their owners
to treat their female ‘servants’ more tenderly than
the male, whose sorrows were genuine enough.</p>

<p>Ned Ward, in his ‘London Spy,’ 1703, gives a
most graphic account of the sort of men who enticed
these human chattels to the plantations. He was
pursuing his perambulations about the City, exercising
those sharp eyes of his, which saw everything,
and was in the neighbourhood of the Custom-house,
when he turned down a place called Pig Hill (so
called, he says, from its resembling the steep descent
down which the Devil drove his Hogs to a Bad
Market).</p>

<p>‘As we walked up the Hill, as Lazily as an Artillery
Captain before his Company upon a Lord Mayor’s
Day, or a Paul’s Labourer up a Ladder, with a Hod
of Mortar, we peeped in at a Gateway, where we
saw two or three Blades, well drest, but with
Hawkes’ Countenances, attended with half-a-dozen
Ragamuffingly Fellows, showing Poverty in their
Rags and Despair in their Faces, mixt with a parcel
of young, wild striplings, like runaway ‘Prentices.
I could not forbear enquiring of my Friend about
the ill-favoured multitude, patched up of such awkward
Figures, that it would have puzzled a Moor-Fields
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
Artist,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> well-read in physiognomy, to have
discovered their Dispositions by their Looks.</p>

<p>‘“That House,” says my Friend, “which they
there are entering is an Office where Servants for
the Plantations bind themselves to be miserable as
long as they live, without a special Providence prevents
it. Those fine Fellows, who look like Footmen
upon a Holy day, crept into cast suits of their
Masters, that want Gentility in their Deportments
answerable to their Apparel, are Kidnappers, who
walk the ‘Change and other parts of the Town, in
order to seduce People who want services and young
Fools crost in Love, and under an uneasiness of
mind, to go beyond the seas, getting so much a
head of Masters of Ships and Merchants who go
over, for every Wretch they trepan into this Misery.
These young Rakes and Tatterdemallions you see
so lovingly hearded are drawn by their fair promises
to sell themselves into Slavery, and the Kidnappers
are the Rogues that run away with the Money.”’</p>

<p>And again, when he goes on ‘Change, he further
attacks these villains.</p>

<p>‘“Now,” says my Friend, “we are got amongst
the Plantation Traders. This may be call’d Kidnapper’s
Walk; for a great many of these Jamaicans
and Barbadians, with their Kitchen-stuff Countenances,
are looking as sharp for servants as a Gang
of Pick-pockets for Booty.... Within that Entry
is an Office of Intelligence, pretending to help
Servants to Places, and Masters to Servants. They
have a knack of Bubbling silly wenches out of their
Money; who loiter hereabouts upon the expectancy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
till they are pick’d up by the Plantation Kidnappers,
and spirited away into a state of misery.”’</p>

<p>And yet once more Ward, in his ‘Trip to America,’
says,</p>

<p>‘We had on board an Irishman going over as
Servant, who, I suppose, was Kidnapped. I asked
him whose Servant he was, “By my Fait,” said he,
“I cannot tell. I was upon ’Change, looking for a
good Master, and a brave Gentleman came to me,
and asked me who I was, and I told him I was
myn own self; and he gave me some good Wine
and good Ale, and brought me on Board, and I have
not seen him since.”’</p>

<p>Then, as since, the emigration from Great Britain
was mostly fed by the poorer classes of Ireland;
and, in the latter part of William III.‘s reign, such
was the numbers that were sent over to the plantations
as ‘servants,’ or in other words, slaves, that
it was found necessary to enact special laws, in
Maryland, to check the excessive importation, it
being considered a source of danger to the State,
as tending to introduce Popery. Accordingly, several
acts were passed, placing a duty of twenty shillings
per head on each Irish person landed; which, proving
insufficient for the purpose, was further increased
to forty shillings a few years afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1743, there was a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, in which James
Annesley, Esq., appeared as the plaintiff, and claimed
the earldom of Anglesey from his uncle Richard,
who, he maintained (and he got a verdict in his
favour), had caused him to be kidnapped when a lad
of thirteen years of age, and sent to America, there
to be sold as a slave. That this was absolutely
the fact, no one who has read the evidence can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
possibly doubt, and the hardships endured by the
‘servants’ at that time are plaintively alluded to
in a little book, called, ‘The Adventure of an Unfortunate
Young Nobleman,’ published 1743. ‘Here
the Captain repeating his former Assurances, he was
sold to a rich Planter in Newcastle County called
Drummond, who immediately took him home, and
entered him in the Number of his Slaves.</p>

<p>‘A new World now opened to him, and, being
set to the felling of Timber, a Work no way proportioned
to his Strength, he did it so awkwardly,
that he was severely corrected. Drummond was a
hard, inexorable Master, who, like too many of the
Planters, consider their Slaves, or Servants, as a
different Species, and use them accordingly. Our
American Planters are not famous for Humanity,
being often Persons of no Education, and, having
been formerly Slaves themselves, they revenge the
ill-usage they received on those who fall into their
Hands. The Condition of European Servants in
that Climate is very wretched; their Work is hard,
and for the most part abroad, exposed to an unwholesome
Air, their Diet coarse, being either Poul
or bread made of Indian Corn, or Homine or Mush,
which is Meal made of the same kind, moistened
with the Fat of Bacon, and their Drink Water sweetened
with a little Ginger and Molasses.’</p>

<p>Although, as before stated, Mr. Annesley won his
case with regard to his legitimacy and property, for
some reason or other he never contested the title with
his usurping uncle, who continued to be recognized
as Earl of Anglesey until his death.</p>

<p>Defoe, writing in 1738 in his ‘History of Colonel
Jack,’ makes his hero to be kidnapped by the master
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
of a vessel at Leith, and carried to Virginia, where
he was consigned to a merchant, and disposed of as
he saw fit&mdash;in fact, treated with the same <i>nonchalance</i>
us an ordinary bale of goods would be. He was sold
to a planter for five years, and had three hard things
to endure, viz., hard work, hard fare, and hard lodging.
He describes the arrival of a ship from London
with several ‘servants,’ and amongst the rest were
seventeen transported felons, some burnt in the hand,
and some not, eight of whom his master purchased
for the time specified in the warrant for their transportation,
so that the unfortunate men were in no
better position than, and were under the same severe
laws as, the convict. Their ranks were recruited by
many gentlemen concerned in the Rebellion, and
taken prisoners at Preston, who were spared from
execution and sold into slavery at the plantations, a
condition which must often have made them dissatisfied
with the clemency extended to them. In many
cases, with kind masters, their lot was not so hard,
and when their time of bondage was expired they
had encouragement given them to plant for themselves,
a certain number of acres being allotted to
them by the State; and, if they could get the necessary
credit for clothes, tools, &amp;c., they were in time
enabled to put by money, and, in some rare instances,
became men of renown in the colony.</p>

<p>The usage these poor people endured on their
passage to the plantations was frequently abominable,
and a writer in 1796 describes the arrival, at Baltimore,
of a vessel containing three hundred Irish
‘passengers’ who had been nearly starved by the
captain, the ship’s water being sold by him at so
much a pint, and this treatment, combined with other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
cruelties too shocking to relate, caused a contagious
disorder to break out on board, which carried off great
numbers, whilst most of these unhappy folk who
were spared at that time, subsequently died whilst
performing quarantine in the Delaware.</p>

<p>The redemptioners mainly sailed from the northern
ports of Ireland, Belfast or Londonderry, though
this country by no means enjoyed the unenviable
monopoly of this traffic: Holland and Germany sending
their wretched quota of white slaves. The particular
class of vessels employed in this iniquitous
trade were known by the name of ‘White Guineamen,’
and belonged to the ‘free and enlightened’
citizens of the sea-ports in America, who had their
kidnappers stationed at certain parts of Scotland,
Ireland, Wales, and also in Holland, to provide them
with human cargoes. Seduced by the glowing
descriptions of a trans-Atlantic paradise, with bright
and alluring visions of American happiness and
liberty, the miserable, the idle, and the unwary
among the lower classes of Europe were entrapped
into the voyage, the offer of gratuitous conveyance
being an additional bait, which was eagerly accepted;
but we have seen how, on their arrival at the
promised land, they were speedily disillusioned. The
difficulty of hiring tolerable servants was so great,
that many persons were obliged to deal with their
fellow-creatures in this way, who would otherwise
have utterly abhorred the thought of being slave-dealers.</p>

<p>Some of the laws for their regulation in the
colonies are curious. For instance, in Virginia, after
they had served their time, they were obliged to have
a certificate from their master to say that they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
done so, and if any person should entertain any hired
servant running away without such a certificate, he
had to pay the master of such servant thirty pounds
weight of tobacco for every day and night he should
so harbour him.</p>

<p>Pursuit after runaway servants was made at the
public expense, and, if caught, they had to serve for
the time of their absence, and the charge disbursed.
In case the master refused to pay the charge, the
servant was sold, or hired out, until by their services
they had reimbursed the amount expended in capturing
them, after which they were returned to their
master to serve out their time. Whoever apprehended
them was to have as reward two hundred pounds
weight of tobacco, if the capture took place about
ten miles from the master’s house, or one hundred
pounds weight if above five miles, and under ten.
This reward was to be paid by the public, and the
servant had to serve some one four months for every
two hundred pounds weight of tobacco paid for him.</p>

<p>‘Every Master that hath a Servant that hath run
away twice, shall keep his Hair close cut, and not so
doing, shall be fined one hundred pounds weight of
Tobacco for every time the said Fugitive shall, after
the second time, be taken up.’</p>

<p>If they ran away in company with any negro, then
they had to serve the master of that negro as long as
the negro was at large. If any servant laid violent
hands on his master, mistress, or overseer, and was
convicted of the same in any court, he had to serve
one year longer at the expiration of his term.</p>

<p>‘A Woman-servant got with Child by her Master,
shall, after her time of indenture or custom is expired,
be, by the Church-wardens of the Parish where she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
lived, sold for two Years, and the Tobacco employed
for the use of the Parish.’</p>

<p>‘No Minister shall publish the Banns, or celebrate
the Contract of Marriage between any Servants, unless
he hath a Certificate from both their Masters that
it is with their consent, under the Penalty of 10,000
lbs. of Tobacco. And the Servants that procure
themselves to be married without their Masters’ consent,
shall each of them serve their respective Master
a year longer than their time; and if any person,
being free, shall marry with a Servant without the
Master’s Licence, he or she so marrying shall pay the
Master 1500 lbs. of Tobacco, or one year’s service.’</p>

<p>In Maryland, the laws respecting servants were
somewhat milder, but, if they ran away, they had to
serve ten days for every one day’s absence. In this
colony, however, ‘Every Man-Servant shall have
given him at the time of the expiration of his Service,
one new Hat, a good Cloath Suit, a new Shift of
White Linnen, a pair of new French full Shooes and
Stockings, two Hoes, and one Axe, and one gun of
20s. price, not above four foot Barrel, nor less than
three and a half. And every Woman-Servant shall
have given her, at the expiration of her Servitude, the
like Provision of Cloaths, and three Barrels of Indian
Corn.’</p>

<p>In New England they dealt still more tenderly and
fairly by their servants. If a servant fled from the
cruelty of his or her master, he or she was to be protected
and harboured, provided that they fled to the
house of some free man of the same town, and ‘If any
Man or Woman Hurt, Maim, or Disfigure a Servant,
unless it be by mere Casualty, the Servant shall go
free, and the Master or Mistress shall make such recompense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
as the Court shall award. Servants that
have serv’d diligently, and faithfully, to the end of
their Times, shall not be sent away empty; and such
as have been unfaithful, negligent, or unprofitable
shall not be sent away unpunished, but shall make
such satisfaction as Authority shall direct.’</p>

<p>In Jamaica the laws were pretty fair, and in Barbadoes
there was a very just enactment. ‘Whatever
Master or Mistress shall turn off a Sick Servant, or
not use, or endeavour, all lawful means for the recovery
of such servant, during the time of Servitude, he
or she shall forfeit 2,200 lbs of Sugar. To be levyed
by Warrant of a Justice of Peace, and disposed towards
the maintenance of such Servant, and the said
Servant so neglected, or turned off, shall be Free.’</p>

<p>In the last few years of the eighteenth century, it
was no uncommon thing to meet with advertisements
in the American papers, couched in the following
strain: ‘To be disposed of, the indentures of a strong,
healthy Irishwoman; who has two years to serve,
and is fit for all kinds of house work. Enquire of the
Printer.’</p>

<h3>‘STOP THE VILLAIN!</h3>

<p>‘Ran away this morning, an Irish Servant, named
Michael Day, by trade a Tailor, about five feet eight
inches high, fair complexion, has a down look when
spoken to, light bushy hair, speaks much in the Irish
dialect, &amp;c. Whoever secures the above-described
in any gaol, shall receive thirty dollars reward, and
all reasonable charges paid. N.B.&mdash;All masters of
Vessels are forbid harbouring or carrying off the said
Servant at their peril.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The laws which regulated them were originally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
framed for the English convicts before the Revolution,
and were not repealed. They were, of necessity,
harsh and severe, so much so that, towards the end of
the eighteenth century, several societies sprang up,
both Irish and German, whose members did all in
their power to mitigate the severity of these laws,
and render their countrymen, during their servitude,
as comfortable as circumstances would permit. These
societies were in all the large towns south of Connecticut.</p>

<p>When the yellow fever was raging in Baltimore
in the year 1793, but few vessels would venture near
the city, and every one that could do so fled from the
doomed place. But a ‘White Guinea-man,’ from
Germany, arrived in the river, and, hearing that such
was the fatal nature of the infection that for no sum
of money could a sufficient number of nurses be procured
to attend the sick, conceived the philanthropic
idea of supplying this deficiency from his redemption
passengers, and, sailing boldly up to the city, he advertised
his cargo for sale thus: ‘A few healthy Servants,
generally between seventeen and twenty-one
years of age; their times will be disposed of by applying
on board the brig.’ It was a truly generous
thought to thus nobly sacrifice his own countrywomen
<i>pro bono publico</i>!</p>

<p>As the eighteenth century drew to a close a more
humane state of things came into existence; and in
Maryland, in 1817, as before stated, a law was passed
for the relief of the German and Swiss redemptioners.
It was enacted that there should be, in every port, a
person to register the apprenticeship, or servitude, of
these emigrants, and, unless drawn up or approved
by him, no agreement to service was binding. Minors,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
under twenty-one, were not allowed to be sold, unless
by their parents or next-of-kin, and the indentures
covenanted that at least two months schooling must
be given, annually, to them by their masters. No
emigrant was bound to serve more than four years,
except males under seventeen, and females under
fourteen, who were to serve, respectively, till twenty-one
and eighteen. There were many other clauses
that related both to their better treatment on board the
vessels and on land, and, if this law had been strictly
acted up to, the condition of these poor people would
have been much ameliorated.</p>

<p>But, happily, in course of years, as the prosperity
of the United States of America grew by ‘leaps and
bounds,’ attracting labour in abundance from all parts
of Europe, there was no longer any need for the
traffic in human flesh and blood, and the redemptioner
became a thing of the past.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Should</span> anyone wish for a graphic account
of Irish life in the later portion of the
eighteenth century, he should read Sir
Jonah Barrington’s ‘Personal Sketches
of Ireland,’ and he will find afterwards
that Lever’s novels afford but a faint reflection of the
manners and customs existing in the west and south
of Ireland. Ignorance, idleness, and dissipation were
the characteristic of the wealthier classes, and a
meeting of the ‘gentry’ could seldom take place
without quarrelling and bloodshed. At races, fairs,
and elections, the lower class enjoyed themselves
likewise, after their kind, in breaking of heads and
drunkenness. It was a singular state of things, but
it must be borne in mind, whilst reading the following
memoirs, as, otherwise, the facts therein related
would scarcely be credited.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>The Fitzgeralds of County Mayo come of an ancient
stock, from no less than the great Geraldine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
family, through the Desmond branch, and George,
the father of George Robert Fitzgerald, had a very
good property at Turlough, near Castlebar. It probably
had some influence in his future career that
‘Fighting Fitzgerald’ should have had for his mother
Lady Mary Hervey, who had been maid-of-honour to
the Princess Amelia, and who was the daughter of
one, and the sister of two, Earls of Bristol. The
family from which she sprang was noted for eccentricity,
so much so, that it passed into a saying that
‘God made Men, Women, and Herveys.’ She did
not live long with her husband, his lax morality and
dissipated manners could not be borne, and she left
him to his own devices and returned to England.
By him she had two sons, George Robert (born 1749),
and Charles Lionel. The elder, in due time, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
sent to Eton, where he seems to have learnt as much
Latin and Greek as was requisite for a gentleman
of those days, and he used occasionally in after life
to write a little poetry now and again, of which
one piece, ‘The Riddle,’ was printed after his
execution.</p>

<p>From Eton he, in 1766, being then in his seventeenth
year, was gazetted to a lieutenancy in the 69th
regiment, and was quartered at Galway, a nice place
for a newly-emancipated schoolboy, and a red-hot,
wild Irishman to boot. Here he soon got into a
scrape, owing to his conduct with a shop-girl, which
ended in a duel, in which neither the combatants
were hurt. He next managed to pick a quarrel with
a young officer of his own regiment, named Thompson,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
who was a quiet and inoffensive man, and they
met. The first round was fired by both without
injury, but Lieutenant Thompson’s second bullet
struck Fitzgerald’s forehead, and he fell. The surgeons,
after examination, came to the conclusion that
the only way to save his life was by performing upon
him the operation of trepanning, or cutting a round
piece out of the skull in order to relieve the pressure
on the brain. It was an operation that was very
risky, but in this case it was successful. Still, one
cannot help thinking, judging by his after career,
that his brain then received some permanent injury
which deprived him of the power of reasoning, and
of control over his actions.</p>

<p>He now left the army, and went home to live with
his father. Here he lived the regular Irishman’s
life of the period: hunting, shooting, cock-fighting,
&amp;c., until he fell in love with a lady of good family,
a Miss Conolly of Castletown; but even here he could
not act as other men do. He could not be married
quietly, but ran away with his bride, and an incident
in their elopement is amusingly told, it being put in
the mouth of his servant.</p>

<p>‘But hoo did the Captain mak’ it up again wi’ the
Square? Ye omadhaun, it was with the young misthress
he med it up; and she took Frinch lave with him,
wan fine moonlight night soon afther. It was mysel’
that had the chaise an’ four waitin’ for them; an’ a
divilish good thing happened at the first inn we
stopt at. The Captain in coorse ordhered the best
dhrawin’-room for the misthress; an’ sure, if it was
goold, she was worthy ov it. But the beggarly-lookin’
waither sed it was taken up with some grand
Englishmen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>‘“Request thim,” sis the Captain, “to accommodate
a lady that’s fatigued, with the apartment.”</p>

<p>‘Well an’ good, the waither delivered the message,
when one of the Englishers roars out, “Damn the
fellow’s cursed insolence, we shan’t give up the room
to any rascal.”</p>

<p>‘“Here,” sis one of thim, “show Paddy this watch,
an’ ax him to tell what o’clock it is.”</p>

<p>‘So the waither brings the watch with the message
in to where the Captain and mysel’ was&mdash;the misthress
had gone with her maid to another room to
change her dhress.</p>

<p>‘“Very well,” sis the Captain, “I think I can show
them what o’clock it is.” So he dhraws his soord,
and puts the point through his chain; “Channor,”
thin says he to me, “attend me.”</p>

<p>‘With that we went in among them, an’ the Captain
sthretched over the watch at the sword’s point to
ache of them, beggin’, with a polite bow, to know to
which o’ thim it belonged. But little notions, ye may
swair, they had ov ownin’ it <i>theirs</i>. Every wan o’
the cowardly rascals swore it did not belong to
himsel’!</p>

<p>‘“Oh, I was thinkin’, jintlemen, it was all a bit ov
a mistake,” sis the Captain, “so I think you must
have it, Channor, for want of a betther owner.” So
with that he hands it over to mysel’. It was a fine
goold watch, an’ here I have it still.’</p>

<p>Not only was young Mrs. Fitzgerald reconciled to
her relations, but an arrangement was made with old
Fitzgerald that, on payment of a certain sum of
money down, he would give his son a rent charge of
&pound;1,000 a year on his estate, and he had a very handsome
fortune with his wife besides.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>The young couple thereupon went to France, and,
having introductions to the best society in Paris,
enjoyed themselves immensely. He dressed splendidly,
and he astonished the Parisians, who asked
each other, ‘Qui est ce seigneur? d’o&ugrave; vient il?
Il n’est pas Fran&ccedil;ais,&mdash;Quelle magnificence! Quelle
politesse! Est-il possible qu’il soit &eacute;tranger?’ In his
hat he wore diamonds, and the same precious stones
adorned his buckles and his sword-knot; indeed, all
through his life he was fond of such gewgaws, and
when his house at Turlough was wrecked by the
mob&mdash;no one preventing&mdash;he estimated his loss in
jewellery, &amp;c., at &pound;20,000. They must have been
costly, for he enumerates among the stolen collection:
‘A casquet containing a complete set of diamond
vest buttons, two large emeralds, a hat-band with
five or six rows of Oriental pearls, worth &pound;1,500, a
large engraved amethyst, a gold watch and chain
studded with diamonds, several other gold watches
and seals, a great number of antique and modern
rings, gold shoe and knee buckles, silver shaving
apparatus, several pairs of silver shoe and knee
buckles, with &pound;6,300 worth of other jewels.’</p>

<p>He joined eagerly in the dissipations of the gay
French capital, especially in gaming, and the twenty
thousand pounds he had with his wife soon came to
an end; and among other people to whom he was in
debt was the Comte d’Artois, afterwards Charles X.,
to whom he owed three thousand pounds. One
evening afterwards he offered a bet of one thousand
pounds on the prince’s hand of cards, which the
Comte d’Artois overhearing, he asked Fitzgerald for
payment, and, being told that it was not then convenient,
the prince took the Irishman by the arm, led
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
him to the top of the stairs, and then, giving him one
kick, left him to get downstairs as quickly as he
could. This indignity was one which it was very
hard on the hot-blooded Irishman to be obliged to
endure, for he might not challenge with impunity a
prince of the blood, and from the public nature of the
insult he naturally lost his place in society. It was
certain he must leave France; but before he left he
must somehow distinguish himself. And he did it in
this wise. The king was hunting at Fontainebleau,
and Fitzgerald, regardless of the etiquette which always
allowed the foremost place to the king and royal
family, took the hunting of the pack upon himself,
riding close to the hounds, cheering and encouraging
them. But for some time the stag kept well in the
open, and gave Fitzgerald no opportunity of showing
off his horsemanship, until it suddenly turned off towards
the river Seine, on the banks of which a wall
had been built. This it leaped, and, to use a hunting
phrase, ‘took soil’ in the river. Over streamed
the hounds, and over flew Fitzgerald, reckless of a
drop of fourteen feet on the other side, going plump
into the river. The hunt stopped at that wall, none
daring to take it, and watched with amazement Fitzgerald
emerge, his feet still in the stirrups, and,
swimming the river, climb the opposite bank and ride
away.</p>

<p>He went to London, where he was well received
in society, notwithstanding that his fame as a duellist
was well known, he having fought eleven duels by
the time he was twenty-four years of age. Whether
it was then that he forced his way into Brookes’ Club
I know not, but it is certain that he did, and as I
cannot tell the story as well as it is told in that most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
amusing but anonymously written book, ‘The Clubs
of London,’ I extract it.</p>

<p>‘Fitzgerald having once applied to Admiral Keith
Stewart to propose him as a candidate for “Brookes’s,”
the worthy admiral, well knowing that he must
either fight or comply with his request, chose the
latter alternative. Accordingly, on the night in
which the balloting was to take place (which was
only a mere form in this case, for even Keith Stewart
himself had resolved to <i>black-ball</i> him), the duellist
accompanied the gallant admiral to St. James’s Street,
and waited in the room below, whilst the suffrages
were taken, in order to know the issue.</p>

<p>‘The ballot was soon over, for without hesitation
every member threw in a <i>black ball</i>, and, when the
scrutiny took place, the company were not a little
amazed to find not even <i>one</i> white one among the
number. However, the point of rejection being
carried <i>nem. con.</i>, the grand affair now was as to
which of the members had the hardihood to announce
the same to the expectant candidate. No one would
undertake the office, for the announcement was sure
to produce a challenge, and a duel with Fighting
Fitzgerald had in almost every case been fatal to his
opponent. The general opinion, however, was that
the proposer, Admiral Stewart, should convey the
intelligence, and that in as polite terms as possible;
but the admiral, who was certainly on all proper
occasions a very gallant officer, was not inclined to
go on any such embassy.</p>

<p>‘“No, gentlemen,” said he; “I proposed the fellow
because I knew you would not admit him; but, by
G&mdash;d, I have no inclination to risk my life against
that of a madman.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>‘“But, admiral,” replied the Duke of Devonshire,
“there being no <i>white ball</i> in the box, he must know
that <i>you</i> have black-balled him as well as the rest,
and he is sure to call you out, at all events.”</p>

<p>‘This was a poser for the poor admiral, who sat
silent for a few seconds amidst the half-suppressed
titter of the members. At length, joining in the
laugh against himself, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>‘“Upon my soul, a pleasant job I’ve got into!
D&mdash;&mdash;n the fellow! No matter! I won’t go. Let
the waiter tell him that there was <i>one</i> black ball,
and that his name must be put up again if he
wishes it.”</p>

<p>‘This plan appeared so judicious that all concurred
in its propriety. Accordingly the waiter was a few
minutes after despatched on the mission.</p>

<p>‘In the meantime Mr. Fitzgerald showed evident
symptoms of impatience at being kept so long from
his “dear friends” above stairs, and frequently rang
the bell to know <i>the state of the poll</i>. On the first
occasion he thus addressed the waiter who answered
his summons:</p>

<p>‘“Come here, my tight little fellow. Do you know
if I am <i>chose</i> yet?”</p>

<p>‘“I really can’t say, sir,” replied the young man,
“but I’ll see.”</p>

<p>‘“There’s a nice little man; be quick, d’ye see,
and I’ll give ye sixpence when ye come with the good
news.”</p>

<p>‘Away went the <i>little man</i>; but he was in no hurry
to come back, for he as well as his fellows was sufficiently
aware of Fitzgerald’s violent temper, and
wished to come in contact with him as seldom as
possible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>‘The bell rang again, and to another waiter the
impatient candidate put the same question:</p>

<p>‘“Am I chose yet, waither?”</p>

<p>‘“The balloting is not over yet, sir,” replied the
man.</p>

<p>‘“Not over yet!” exclaimed Fitzgerald. “But,
sure, there is no use of balloting at all when my dear
friends are all unanimous for me to come in. Run,
my man, and let me know how they are getting on.”</p>

<p>‘After the lapse of another quarter-of-an-hour, the
bell was rung so violently as to produce a contest
among the poor servants, as to whose turn it was to
visit the lion in his den! and Mr. Brookes, seeing no
alternative but resolution, took the message from the
waiter, who was descending the staircase, and boldly
entered the room with a coffee equipage in his hand.</p>

<p>‘“Did you call for coffee, sir?”</p>

<p>‘“D&mdash;n your coffee, sur! and you too,” answered
Mr. Fitzgerald, in a voice which made the host’s
blood curdle in his veins&mdash;“I want to know, sur, and
that without a moment’s delay, sur, if I am <i>chose</i> yet.”</p>

<p>‘“Oh, sir!” replied Mr. Brookes, who trembled
from head to foot, but attempted to smile away the
appearance of fear, “I beg your pardon, sir; but I
was just coming to announce to you, sir, with Admiral
Stewart’s compliments, sir, that unfortunately
there was one black ball in the box, sir; and, consequently,
by the rules of the club, sir, no candidate
can be admitted without a new election, sir; which
cannot take place, by the standing regulations of the
club, sir, until one month from this time, sir!”</p>

<p>‘During this address Fitzgerald’s irascibility appeared
to undergo considerable mollification; and,
at its conclusion, the terrified landlord was not a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
little surprised and pleased to find his guest shake
him by the hand, which he squeezed heartily between
his own two, saying,</p>

<p>‘“My dear Mr. Brookes, <i>I’m chose</i>; and I give ye
much joy: for I’ll warrant ye’ll find me the best customer
in your house! But there must be a small
matter of mistake in my election; and, as I should not
wish to be so ungenteel as to take my sate among
my dear friends above-stairs, until that mistake is
duly rectified, you’ll just step up and make my compliments
to the gentlemen, and say, as it is only a
mistake of <i>one</i> black ball, they will be so good as to
waive all ceremony on my account, and proceed to
re-elect their humble servant without any more delay
at all; so now, my dear Mr. Brookes, you may put
down the coffee, and I’ll be drinking it whilst the
new election is going on!”</p>

<p>‘Away went Mr. Brookes, glad enough to escape
with whole bones, for this time at least. On announcing
the purport of his errand to the assembly
above-stairs, many of the members were panic-struck,
for they clearly foresaw that some disagreeable circumstance
was likely to be the finale of the farce
they had been playing. Mr. Brookes stood silent for
some minutes, waiting for an answer, whilst several
of the members whispered, and laughed, in groups,
at the ludicrous figure which they all cut. At length
the Earl of March (afterwards Duke of Queensbury)
said aloud,</p>

<p>‘“Try the effect of <i>two</i> black balls; d&mdash;&mdash;n his
Irish impudence; if two balls don’t take effect upon
him, I don’t know what will.” This proposition met
with unanimous approbation, and Mr. Brookes was
ordered to communicate accordingly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>‘On re-entering the waiting-room, Mr. Fitzgerald
rose hastily from his chair, and, seizing him by the
hand, eagerly inquired,</p>

<p>‘“Have they elected me right now, Mr. Brookes?”</p>

<p>‘“I hope no offence, Mr. Fitzgerald,” said the
landlord, “but I am sorry to inform you that the
result of the second balloting is&mdash;that <i>two</i> black balls
were dropped in, sir.”</p>

<p>‘“By J&mdash;&mdash;s, then,” exclaimed Fitzgerald, “there’s
now <i>two</i> mistakes instead of one. Go back, my dear
friend, and tell the honourable members that it is a
very uncivil thing to keep a gentleman waiting
below-stairs, with no one to keep him company but
himself, whilst they are enjoying themselves with
their champagne, and their cards, and their Tokay,
up above. Tell them to try again, and I hope they
will have better luck this time, and make no more
mistakes, because it’s getting late, and I won’t be
chose to-night at all. So now, Mr. Brookes, be off
with yourself, and lave the door open till I see what
despatch you make.”’</p>

<p>Away went Mr. Brookes for the last time. On announcing
his unwelcome errand, everyone saw that
palliative measures only prolonged the dilemma: and
General Fitzpatrick proposed that Brookes should tell
him: “His cause was hopeless, for that he was
<i>black-balled all over</i> from head to foot, and it was
hoped by all the members that Mr. Fitzgerald would
not persist in thrusting himself into society where his
company was declined.”</p>

<p>‘This message, it was generally believed, would
prove a sickener, as it certainly would have done to
any other candidate under similar circumstances. Not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
so, however, to Fitzgerald, who no sooner heard the
purport of it, than he exclaimed,</p>

<p>‘“Oh, I perceive it is <i>a mistake altogether</i>, Mr.
Brookes, and I must see to the rectifying of it myself;
there’s nothing like dealing with principals, and
so I’ll step up at once, and put the thing to rights,
without any more unnecessary delay.”</p>

<p>‘In spite of Mr. Brookes’s remonstrance that his
entrance into the club-room was against all rule and
etiquette, Fitzgerald found his way up-stairs, threatening
to throw the landlord over the bannisters for
endeavouring to stop him. He entered the room
without any further ceremony than a bow, saying to
the members, who indignantly rose up at this most
unexpected intrusion,</p>

<p>‘“Your servant, gentlemen! I beg ye will be
sated.” Walking up to the fire-place, he thus addressed
Admiral Stewart: “So, my dear admiral,
Mr. Brookes informs me that I have been <i>elected</i> three
times.”</p>

<p>‘“You have been balloted for, Mr. Fitzgerald, but
I am sorry to say you have not been chosen,” said
Stewart.</p>

<p>‘“Well, then,” replied the duellist, “did you black-ball
me?”</p>

<p>‘“My good sir,” answered the admiral, “how could
you suppose such a thing?”</p>

<p>‘“Oh, I <i>supposed</i> no such thing, my dear fellow, I
only want to know who it was dropped the black
balls in by accident, as it were.”</p>

<p>‘Fitzgerald now went up to each individual member,
and put the same question <i>seriatim</i>, “Did you
black-ball me, sir?” until he made the round of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
whole club; and it may well be supposed that in
every case he obtained similar answers to that of the
admiral. When he had finished his inquisition, he
thus addressed the whole body, who preserved as
dread and dead a silence as the urchins at a parish
school do on a Saturday when the pedagogue orders
half-a-score of them to be <i>horsed</i> for neglecting their
catechism, which they have to repeat to the parson
on Sunday:</p>

<p>‘“You see, gentlemen, that as none of ye have
black-balled me, <i>I must be chose</i>; and it is Misthur
Brookes that has made the mistake. But I was convinced
of it from the beginning, and I am only sorry
that so much time has been lost as to prevent
honourable gentlemen from enjoying each other’s
good company sooner. Waither! Come here, you
rascal, and bring me a bottle of champagne, till I
drink long life to the club, and wish them joy of
their unanimous election of a raal gentleman by father
and mother, and&mdash;” this part of Fitzgerald’s address
excited the risible muscles of everyone present; but
he soon restored them to their former lugubrious
position by casting around him a ferocious look, and
saying, in a voice of thunder&mdash;“<i>and who never missed
his man</i>! Go for the champagne, waithur; and, d’ye
hear, sur, tell your masthur&mdash;Misthur Brookes, that is&mdash;not
to make any more mistakes about black balls,
for, though it is below a gentleman to call him out, I
will find other means of giving him a bagful of broken
bones.”</p>

<p>‘The members now saw that there was nothing for
it but to send the intruder to Coventry, which they
appeared to do by tacit agreement; for when Admiral
Stewart departed, which he did almost immediately,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Mr. Fitzgerald found himself completely cut by all
“his dear friends.” The gentlemen now found themselves
in groups at the several whist-tables, and no
one chose to reply to his observations, nor to return
even a nod to the toasts and healths which he drank
whilst discussing three bottles of the sparkling liquor
which the terrified waiter placed before him in succession.
At length, finding that no one would communicate
with him in either kind, either for drinking
or for fighting, he arose, and, making a low bow, took
his leave as follows:</p>

<p>‘“Gentlemen, I bid you all good night; I am glad
to find ye so <i>sociable</i>. I’ll take care to come earlier
next night, and we’ll have a little more of it, please
G&mdash;d.”</p>

<p>‘The departure of this bully was a great relief to
everyone present, for the restraint caused by his
vapouring and insolent behaviour was intolerable.
The conversation immediately became general, and
it was unanimously agreed that half-a-dozen stout
constables should be in waiting the next evening to
lay him by the heels and bear him off to the watch-house
if he attempted again to intrude. Of some
such measure Fitzgerald seemed to be aware, for he
never showed himself at “Brookes’s” again, though
he boasted everywhere that he had been unanimously
chosen a member of the club.’</p>

<p>He lived the life of a man about town, and not a
very reputable one, either a bully whom everyone
feared and no one liked, until the summer of 1773,
when he appeared before the public in a dispute of
which there is a long account in a contemporary
pamphlet, ‘The Vauxhall Affray, or Macaronies
defeated.’ The Rev. Henry Bate (afterwards Sir H.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
B. Dudley), the proprietor and editor of the <i>Morning
Post</i>, was at Vauxhall in company with Mrs. Hartley,
the actress, her husband, Mr. Colman, and a friend,
when Fitzgerald, accompanied by the Hon. Thomas
Lyttleton, Captain Croftes, and some others, all more
or less intoxicated, behaved so rudely to Mrs. Hartley
that she could stand it no longer, and complained.
Parson Bate was a notable ‘bruiser,’ and he took her
part, and struck Croftes a blow. Cards were exchanged,
and next morning an interview was arranged,
at which the clergyman and officer were reconciled,
when in bounced Fitzgerald, and declared, in a most
insolent manner, that Mr. Bate should give immediate
satisfaction to his friend, Captain Miles, whom, he said,
the former had grossly insulted the evening before.
Miles was introduced, and declared that he had been
affronted by the clergyman, and if he did not immediately
strip and fight with him, he (Miles) would
post him as a coward, and cane him wherever he
met him.</p>

<p>Mindful of his cloth, Mr. Bate hesitated; but Miles,
saying something about cowardice, the parson threw
all consideration of his calling to the winds, a ring
was formed, and Captain Miles received the handsomest
thrashing he ever had. Soon afterwards it transpired
that Captain Miles was Fitzgerald’s own servant,
who had been compelled by his master so to behave.
Mr. Bate very properly exposed the affair in the
<i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p>We next hear of him engaged in a duel with Captain
Scawen of the Guards, which was fought at
Lille, and twice he fired before his adversary. Luckily
he missed him, and the second time the captain,
having fired in the air, the affair ended.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>He was concerned in another duel, which made
some stir at the time (1775). There was a young
fellow named Walker, the son of a plumber and
painter, whose father left him a large fortune, and
Daisy Walker, as he was called, became a cornet in
Burgoyne’s Light Dragoons. His fortune soon went
in gambling, and he had to retire from the service,
whilst his guardians looked into his affairs. At that
time Fitzgerald held a bill of his for three thousand
pounds, and pressed for payment. It was ultimately
compromised, and, on receipt of five hundred pounds,
he gave up the bill. Subsequently Daisy Walker
made some lucky bets, and Fitzgerald at once became
clamourous for payment of two thousand five
hundred pounds. Walker denied his liability, saying
the matter was settled by the payment of five
hundred pounds and the return of the bill; but this
was not Fitzgerald’s view of the matter, and he
dunned young Walker whenever he met him, and at
last, at Ascot races, he cut him across the face with
his cane.</p>

<p>Of course, in those days, there could be but one
course to be taken, and a challenge was sent, and
accepted. Walker, as being the insulted party, should
fire first. They duly met, and the distance was fixed
at ten paces, but the second who measured the ground
took such strides that it was virtually twelve paces.
Walker fired, and his antagonist was unhurt. Fitzgerald,
who had the whole etiquette of the duello at
his finger’s ends, then stepped forward and apologised
for having struck Walker&mdash;which apology was accepted.
But, as soon as this ceremony was finished, Fitzgerald
again began dunning for his &pound;2,500, and, when
he was told that it was not owing, he prepared to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
take his shot, offering to bet &pound;1,000 that he hit his
adversary. The pistol missed fire, and he calmly
chipped the flint, reiterating his offer to bet. He
fired, and the ball grazed Walker in the arm just
below the shoulder, but did not wound him, and
they left the field. Subsequently, however, Fitzgerald
declared that Walker was ‘papered,’ <i>i.e.</i>, protected
in some way, and published an account of
the duel in a pamphlet, addressed to the Jockey
Club. To this Walker replied, and Fitzgerald
followed up with another pamphlet, in which he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘I should most certainly have fixed it at <i>six</i> instead
of <i>ten</i> paces. My predilection for that admeasurement
of ground is founded upon the strictest principles of
humanity. For I know, from trials successively repeated,
twenty times one after the other, I can, at
that distance, hit any part of the human body to a
<i>line</i>, which, possibly you may know, is only the <i>twelfth
part of an inch</i>.’</p>

<p>And he again refers to his pistol-practice. ‘So,
then, you had one Surtout on; are you certain you
had not half-a-dozen? If no more than one Surtout,
pray how many coats and waistcoats? You give us
no account of your under-garments. I ask these
questions, Sir, because, after reading your pamphlet,
I took the same pistol, charged it with the same
quantity of powder, used a bullet cast in the same
mould, measured out twelve good paces with a yard
wand, and then fired at a thick stick, which I had
previously covered over with two waistcoats lined,
one coat lined, and one double-milled drab Surtout.
What think you, Sir, was the result? Why, Sir, the
ball penetrated through the Surtout, the coat, two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
waistcoats, and lodged itself an inch deep in the
stick. There is nothing like experimental philosophy
for a fair proof, it beats your <i>ipse dixits</i> all halloo.
You see how ingeniously I pass away my private
hours&mdash;I am always hard at study.’</p>

<p>This affair made London too hot for him, and he
went over to France with an old brother officer named
Baggs, and they picked up a living by horse-racing
and gambling&mdash;which led to a duel between the
two, for Baggs had fleeced a young Englishman
named Sandford, and there was a quarrel as to the
division of the spoil, which ended in Fitzgerald drawing
his gloves across Baggs’ face, and Baggs returning
the compliment by dashing his hat in his partner’s
face. Of course the outcome of this was a duel, which
is graphically described by Hamilton Rowan in his
‘Autobiography.’</p>

<p>‘They fired together, and were in the act of levelling
their second pistols, when Baggs fell on his side,
saying,</p>

<p>‘“Sir, I am wounded.”</p>

<p>‘“But you are not dead!” said Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>‘At the same moment he discharged his second
pistol at his fallen antagonist.</p>

<p>‘Baggs immediately started on his legs and advanced
on Fitzgerald, who, throwing the empty pistol
at him, quitted his station, and kept a zig-zag course
across the field, Baggs following. I saw the flash of
Bagg’s second pistol, and, at the same moment, Fitzgerald
lay stretched on the ground. I was just in
time to catch Baggs as he fell, after firing his second
shot. He swooned from intense pain, the small bone
of his leg being broken. Mr. Fitzgerald now came
up, saying,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>‘“We are both wounded; let us go back to our
ground.”’</p>

<p>But this could not be allowed, and the wounded
were carried home. Fitzgerald’s wound was in the
thigh, and rendered him slightly lame ever after.</p>

<p>When he got well, he returned to Ireland, and,
thanks to his uncle, the Earl of Bristol and Bishop of
Derry, he lived in very fair style, either in Merrion
Street, Dublin, or at Rockfield, near Turlough. While
living in Dublin he fought a duel with John Toler
(afterwards Lord Norbury), fired a pistol at Denis
Browne, Lord Altamont’s brother, in Sackville Street,
in broad daylight, and insulted and struck John
Fitzgibbon, afterwards Lord Chancellor Clare.</p>

<p>Death now took away his guardian-angel, his
amiable and patient wife, leaving him a little daughter.
His grief for her loss was extravagant, and amounted
to little short of frenzy. After the funeral he behaved
more than ever like a madman. He took to hunting
by night, and hunted anything that was about after
dark. In this wild chase he was always accompanied
by a band of mounted servants, carrying
torches, and, when the peasants were roused from
their slumbers by the noise of hounds, and the cries of
men, they knew that Mad Fitzgerald was abroad.</p>

<p>When he hunted by day, he would peremptorily
order home anyone to whom he had even a fancied
dislike. He would tell one man to go home for he
was more fitted to follow the plough than the hounds;
another would be bidden to go and mind his sheep,
and a third would be told to quit the field, as he was
too fat for the sport. And they had to go, for their
monitor would not have scrupled to have used his
whip, and, if that had been objected to, there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
always the <i>ultima ratio</i> of a duel, and men were rather
shy of meeting ‘Fighting Fitzgerald.’</p>

<p>He had a particular dislike to the family of Lord
Altamont, and behaved in a most high-handed and
outrageous manner towards them. For instance, he
heard that a relation of my lord’s, a Mr. Browne, was
out shooting on a bog near Westport, so he got
together his men and dogs, and went in quest of him.
When Mr. Browne saw him enter on the scene, he
retired; Fitzgerald pursued, Mr. Browne increased
his pace, so did Fitzgerald, until he literally hunted
the offending sportsman home. Another time he
rode over to Lord Altamont’s house, and asked to
see the wolf-dog, which, for its size and fierceness,
was the admiration and terror of the neighbourhood.
No sooner was he shown the dog than he shot it,
charging the servants to tell their master that, until
he became more charitable to the poor, who only
came to his door to be barked at and bitten, he
should not allow such a beast to be kept, but that he
had no objection to the three ladies of the family
each keeping a lap-dog.</p>

<p>After a time, his grief at the loss of his wife subsided,
and he fell in love with the only child and heiress
of a Mr. Vaughan, of Carrowmore, County Mayo, and
singularly, although she well knew his reckless
character, she returned his affection. We know how
he ran away with his first wife; the story of his
wedding with his second is yet more romantic.</p>

<p>Mr. Vaughan was, not unnaturally, averse to Fitzgerald
marrying his daughter, but, at the same time,
he did not forbid him the house. So one night Fitzgerald
was suddenly attacked by a very acute illness,
writhing about in great agony, and at last begged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
to be allowed to remain there that night. In the
morning he was much worse, and at death’s door,
lamenting the iniquity of his past life, and begging
that a priest should be sent for. Of course one soon
came, but, in the midst of his spiritual exercises,
Fitzgerald sprang out of bed, and, presenting a
pistol to the head of the priest, swore he would blow
out his brains if he did not instantly marry him to
Miss Vaughan, and the terror-stricken priest had no
option but to comply. Mr. Vaughan had to bow to
the inevitable, and the new Mrs. Fitzgerald never
had reason to complain of her husband’s treatment of
her, as he was uniformly kind and affectionate to her.</p>

<p>When Fitzgerald returned to Ireland, he found his
father, a weak, false, vicious old man, almost in his
dotage, and entirely under the control of his younger
son Lionel, a low woman whom he had taken as his
mistress, and an unscrupulous pettifogger named
Patrick Randal MacDonnell. Charles Lionel, the
younger son, was his brother’s enemy, because he
saw nothing but poverty before him if his father
paid George Robert the &pound;1,000 a year to which he
was entitled, for the old spendthrift was always in
debt. The mistress had every reason to keep things
as they were, and MacDonnell did not like to see his
pickings done away with. It is questionable whether
Fitzgerald had ever received any portion of his
settlement&mdash;at all events, it was &pound;12,000 in arrear.
He saw the estate that was ultimately to come to
him being wasted, his father getting more hopelessly
into debt, and spending his substance on an
immoral and greedy woman, and he was determined
to put a stop to it. He had a difficulty to get a
solicitor in Dublin to undertake his case, but at last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
he found one, and arranged with him to accompany
him in his carriage to Mayo. The story of that ride
is told by Sir Jonah Barrington (vol. iii, p. 170, ed.
1832) as follows:</p>

<p>‘Mr. Fitzgerald sent for the attorney, and told him
that, if his going down was previously known, there
would be several of the tenants and others, under the
adverse influence of his father and brother, who
would probably abscond, and that, therefore, since
spies were watching him perpetually, to give notice
in the county of his every movement, it was expedient
that he should set out two or three hours
before daybreak, so as to have the start of them.
That his own travelling-carriage should be ready
near the gate of the Phœnix Park to take up Mr.
T&mdash;&mdash;, who might bring his trunk of papers with
him in a hack-carriage, so that there should be no
suspicion.</p>

<p>‘All this was reasonable and proper, and accordingly
done. Mr. Fitzgerald’s carriage was on the
spot named, near the wall of the Phœnix Park. The
attorney was punctual, the night pitch dark, and the
trunk of papers put into the boot; the windows were
all drawn up. Mr. T&mdash;&mdash; stepped into the carriage
with as great satisfaction as ever he had felt in his
whole lifetime, and away they drove cheerily, at a
good round pace, for the county of Galway.</p>

<p>‘Mr. T&mdash;&mdash; had no idea that anybody else was
coming with them, Mr. Fitzgerald not having mentioned
such a thing. He found, however, a third
gentleman in a travelling-cloak sitting between himself
and his client, who was dozing in the far corner.
The stranger, too, he found not over-courteous; for,
though the carriage was not very roomy, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
gentleman was bulky, he showed no disposition
whatever to accommodate the attorney, who begged
him, with great suavity and politeness, to “move a
little.” To this he received no reply, but a snoring
both from the strange traveller and Mr. Fitzgerald.
Mr. T&mdash;&mdash; now felt himself much crowded and
pressed, and again earnestly requested “the gentleman”
to allow him, if possible, a little more room;
but he only received a snore in return. He now
concluded that his companion was a low, vulgar
fellow. His nerves became rather lax; he got
alarmed, without well knowing why; he began to
twitter&mdash;the twitter turned into a shake, and, as is
generally the case, the shake ended with a cold
sweat, and Mr. T&mdash;&mdash; found himself in a state of
mind and body far more disagreeable than he had
ever before experienced.</p>

<p>‘The closeness and pressure had elicited a hot
perspiration on the one side, while his fears produced
a cold perspiration on the other, so that (quite unlike
the ague he had not long recovered from) he had hot
and cold fits at the same moment. All his apprehensions
were now awakened; his memory opened her
stores, and he began to recollect dreadful anecdotes
of Mr. Fitzgerald, which he never before had credited,
or indeed had any occasion to remember. The
ruffians of Turlow passed as the ghosts in “Macbeth”
before his imagination. Mr. Fitzgerald, he supposed,
was in a fox’s sleep, and his bravo in another, who,
instead of receding at all, on the contrary, squeezed
the attorney closer and closer. His respiration now
grew impeded, and every fresh idea exaggerated his
horror; his untaxed costs, he anticipated, would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
prove his certain death, and that a cruel one. Neither
of his companions would answer him a single
question, the one replying only by a rude snore, and
the other by a still ruder.</p>

<p>‘“Now,” thought Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;, “my fate is consummated.
I have often heard how Mr. Fitzgerald cut
a Jew’s throat in Italy, and slaughtered numerous
creditors while on the grand tour of Europe. God
help me! unfortunate solicitor that I am, my last
day, or rather night, has come!”</p>

<p>‘He thought to let down the window and admit a
little fresh air, but it was quite fast. The whole
situation was insupportable, and at length he addressed
Mr. Fitzgerald, most pathetically, thus:</p>

<p>‘“Mr. Fitzgerald, I’ll date the receipt the moment
you choose, and whenever it’s your convenience I
have no doubt you’ll pay it most honourably&mdash;no
doubt, no doubt, Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;but not necessary
at all till perfectly convenient, or never, if more
agreeable to you and this other gentleman.”</p>

<p>‘Fitzgerald could now contain himself no longer,
but said, quite in good humour,</p>

<p>‘“Oh, very well, Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;, very well, quite time
enough; make yourself easy on that head.”</p>

<p>‘The carriage now arrived at Maynooth, where the
horses were instantly changed, and they proceeded
rapidly on their journey, Mr. Fitzgerald declaring he
would not alight till he reached Turlow, for fear of
pursuit.</p>

<p>‘The attorney now took courage, and, very truly
surmising that the other gentleman was a foreigner,
ventured to beg of Mr. Fitzgerald to ask “his friend”
to sit over a little, as he was quite crushed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>‘Mr. Fitzgerald replied, “That the party in question
did not speak English, but when they arrived
at Killcock the matter should be better arranged.”</p>

<p>‘The attorney was now compelled for some time
longer to suffer the hot press, inflicted with as little
compunction as if he were only a sheet of paper;
but, on arriving at the inn at Killcock, dawn just
appeared, and Mr. Fitzgerald, letting down a window,
desired his servant, who was riding with a pair
of large horse-pistols before him, to rouse the people
at the inn, and get some cold provisions and a bottle
of wine brought to the carriage. “And, Thomas,”
said he, “get five or six pounds of raw meat, if you
can&mdash;no matter of what kind&mdash;for this foreign gentleman.”</p>

<p>‘The attorney was now petrified; a little twilight
glanced into the carriage, and nearly turned him
into stone. The stranger was wrapped up in a blue
travelling cloak with a scarlet cape, and had a great
white cloth tied round his head and under his chin;
but when Mr. Solicitor saw the face of his companion
he uttered a piteous cry, and involuntarily ejaculated,
“Murder! murder!” On hearing this cry, the servant
rode back to the carriage window and pointed
to his pistols. Mr. T&mdash;&mdash; now offered up his soul to
God, the stranger grumbled, and Mr. Fitzgerald,
leaning across, put his hand to the attorney’s mouth,
and said he should direct his servant to give him
reason for that cry, if he attempted to alarm the
people of the house. Thomas went into the inn, and
immediately returned with a bottle of wine and some
bread, but reported that there was no raw meat to
be had; on hearing which, Mr. Fitzgerald ordered
him to seek some at another house.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>‘The attorney now exclaimed again, “God protect
me!” Streaming with perspiration, his eye every
now and then glancing towards his mysterious companion,
and then, starting aside with horror, he at
length shook as if he were relapsing into his old
ague; and the stranger, finding so much unusual
motion beside him, turned his countenance upon the
attorney. Their cheeks came in contact, and the
reader must imagine&mdash;because it is impossible adequately
to describe&mdash;the scene that followed. The
stranger’s profile was of uncommon prominence; his
mouth stretched from ear to ear, he had enormous
grinders, with a small twinkling eye, and his visage
was all be-whiskered and mustachioed&mdash;more, even,
than Count Platoff’s of the Cossacks.</p>

<p>‘Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;’s optic nerves were paralysed as he
gazed instinctively at his horrid companion, in whom,
when he recovered his sense of vision sufficiently to
scrutinize him, he could trace no similitude to any
being on earth save a bear!</p>

<p>‘And the attorney was quite correct in this comparison.
It was actually a Russian bear, which Mr.
Fitzgerald had educated from a cub, and which
generally accompanied his master on his travels.
He now gave Bruin a rap upon the nose with a
stick which he carried, and desired him to hold up
his head. The brute obeyed. Fitzgerald then ordered
him to “kiss his neighbour,” and the bear did
as he was told, but accompanied his salute with such
a tremendous roar as roused the attorney (then
almost swooning) to a full sense of his danger.
Self-preservation is the first law of Nature, and at
once gives courage, and suggests devices. On this
occasion, every other kind of law&mdash;civil, criminal, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
equitable&mdash;was set aside by the attorney. All his
ideas, if any he had, were centred in one word&mdash;“escape”;
and as a weasel, it is said, will attack
a man if driven to desperation, so did the attorney
spurn the menaces of Mr. Fitzgerald, who endeavoured
to hold and detain him.</p>

<p>‘The struggle was violent, but brief; Bruin roared
loud, but interfered not. Horror strengthened the
solicitor. Dashing against the carriage-door, he burst
it open, and, tumbling out, reeled into the public-house&mdash;then
rushing through a back-door, and up a
narrow lane that led to the village of Summer Hill
(Mr. Roly’s demesne), about two miles distant, he
stumbled over hillocks, tore through hedges and
ditches, and never stopped till he came, breathless,
to the little alehouse, completely covered with mud,
and his clothes in rags. He there told so incoherent
a story, that the people all took him for a man either
bitten by a mad dog, or broken loose from his
keepers, and considered it their duty to tie him,
to prevent his biting, or other mischief. In that
manner they led him to Squire Roly’s, at the great
house, where the hapless attorney was pinioned and
confined in a stable for some hours, till the squire
got up. They put plenty of milk, bread, butter, and
cheese into the manger, from the cock-loft above,
to prevent accidents, as they said.’</p>

<p>Fitzgerald, finding the estate going to the dogs&mdash;for
his father was letting the lands at absurdly
low prices to his favourites; as, for instance, he let
his son Charles Lionel a valuable tract of land worth
fifteen shillings an acre at one shilling and sixpence,
and the deer park at the same price&mdash;took the necessary
legal proceedings to protect himself; and, whilst
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
they were pending, his father was arrested for a debt
of &pound;8,000, and taken to a Dublin sponging-house.
Although his father had been trying to injure him
by all the means in his power, yet Fitzgerald paid
the debt, and became responsible for the other debts
of his father, who, in return, ratified the settlement
which had been in abeyance so long.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald then applied to the Lord Chancellor for
possession of the estate, on the grounds that, under
its present management, the property was deteriorating,
and as security for the money his father owed
him, which amounted to &pound;20,000&mdash;&pound;12,000 of which
were arrears of his income of &pound;1,000 per annum, and
&pound;8,000 lent to obtain his release; and, in 1780, the
Chancellor made the order as prayed. Had Fitzgerald
gone with bailiffs, and demanded possession,
there would have been bloodshed, in all probability;
for the King’s writs did not run easily in that part
of Ireland. So he waited until one day, when his
father went over to Turlough, and he then made a
forcible entry into Rockfield, with a troop of armed
dependants, and dislodged the servants then in the
house.</p>

<p>Naturally his father did not take this quietly, and
possession was not held peacefully. There were
many collisions; and old Fitzgerald indicted his son
for having headed a riotous mob, one of whom, he
alleged, had, at his son’s instigation, attempted to
take away his life, by firing a loaded musket at him.
The charge could not be sufficiently proved, and
Fitzgerald was acquitted.</p>

<p>He now turned his attention towards improving
his estate, and imported some Scotch Presbyterians,
a sober and industrious set of men, to whom he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
gave five hundred pounds towards building a meeting-house,
and settled fifty pounds per annum on
their minister; but his father’s party were always
annoying him, and, in consequence, he refused to
give maintenance to his father, who, thereupon, had
recourse to the law-courts in Dublin to compel him
so to do; and a writ was issued empowering the
father to secure the body of his son until a maintenance
was granted him. It would have been perfectly
useless to have served the writ upon him at
Turlough: it is probable no man could have been
found bold enough to attempt it. So they waited
until the next assizes at Balinrobe; and then, when
they thought they had him safe in the grand jury
room, they made application to the judge to arrest
him there. Leave was granted, but Fitzgerald got
wind of it, and when they went to capture him, lo!
he was not to be found.</p>

<p>He evidently thought two could play at that game,
and he determined to get the old man into his power.
In those days, in that part of Ireland, law was not
much regarded, especially by men of Fighting Fitzgerald’s
stamp; and he speedily put his plan into
execution. As his father was going from Balinrobe
to Dublin, he was waylaid by his son and a party of
armed men, and carried off <i>vi et armis</i> to George
Robert’s house at Turlough.</p>

<p>This open violation of the law could not be submitted
to tamely, and his younger brother went to
Dublin, and stated his case before the judges, who
granted him a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. But no one
would serve that at Turlough, so they waited, as of
aforetime, until he was at the grand jury room, and,
leave having been given, his brother, who was bigger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
and stronger than he, went in, and, literally collaring
him, dragged him out, spite of all his protests that he
was a grand jury man, and could not be touched
while in the exercise of his functions. He was at
once put on his trial, and the grand jury found a
true bill against him, unanimously: nay, more, they
publicly addressed the judge in court, expressing
their abhorrence of the charge made against Fitzgerald.
After the finding of a true bill, his trial at
once took place, in despite of all efforts to postpone
it to the next assizes, and it lasted from nine in the
morning until nearly twelve at night, when, the
judge having summed up, the jury found him guilty,
and he was fined &pound;1,000, to be imprisoned for three
years, and until he should pay the fine.</p>

<p>What happens next in this man’s extraordinary
career is almost difficult to believe, and shows the
lawless state of the country. Fitzgerald was committed
to Castlebar prison, but he seems to have been
at large therein, for, four days after his committal, he
calmly walked out of gaol, armed with a brace of
pistols, and scattering a bag of silver to be scrambled
for by the gaolers. The doors were all open, a horse
was in readiness, and off he went, tantivy, for
Turlough, where he was welcomed by his people with
volleys of small arms and discharge of cannon. These
latter Fitzgerald had procured from a ship, under the
pretext that they would be useful for his volunteers,
of which he was the colonel. These he mounted as
a regular battery, and it was garrisoned in a perfectly
military manner by his volunteers.</p>

<p>But an escape from prison was, by the law of Ireland,
deemed a capital felony, and the sheriff of the
county issued proclamations and rewards for his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
apprehension, at which Fitzgerald only laughed, for
he could rely on his men, and he had his father still
in his custody, as the old man did not go away when
his son was, as he thought, safely imprisoned. He
was some fifteen months at large before the majesty
of the law asserted itself. Then a little army, consisting
of three companies of foot, a troop of horse,
and a battery of artillery, under the command of
Major Longford, was sent to reduce this rebel. But,
when they got to Rockfield, they found the cannon
spiked, and the birds flown to Killala, whither they
were followed by Charles Lionel, at the head of the
Castlebar volunteers. But many people gathered
round Fitzgerald, and he soon had a party which
was too strong for them to attack. But, a large reinforcement
arriving, he had to flee, and, with his
father, and two or three attendants, he put to sea in
an open boat, landing on a small island in the bay of
Sligo.</p>

<p>Here his father offered him terms, that if he would
give him &pound;3,000 to clear off his debts, and pay him a
small annuity, he would give him up the estate, and
completely exonerate him of all blame in his capture
and detention. To these terms Fitzgerald assented,
and set off with his father through bye, and unfrequented
roads to Dublin. But no sooner had the
old man got into his old lodging, than he refused to
ratify his bargain, and set his son at defiance.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald, although there was a reward out of
&pound;300 for his apprehension, took no pains to conceal
himself, and, consequently, had not been long in
Dublin, before Town-Major Hall heard of his whereabouts,
and, taking twelve soldiers of the Castle
guard with him, arrested Fitzgerald, and safely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
lodged him in the Castle, where he was confined
in the officer’s room; and there he abode till
the general election, when, through the influence of
his powerful friends, he was released. During his
incarceration he wrote an appeal to the public on his
case, although some say the author was one Timothy
Brecknock, a somewhat unscrupulous lawyer whom
Fitzgerald employed.</p>

<p>The first use he made of his newly-acquired liberty
was to revenge himself on a man who he fancied
had done him some grievous injury, a somewhat
eccentric gentleman named Dick Martin, and he determined
to insult him in the most public manner.
He met him at the theatre, struck him with his cane,
calling him the bully of the Altamonts, and walked
away. Of course, in those days a gentleman so
insulted could but do one thing, and that was to
send a challenge&mdash;and Martin did send Fitzgerald
one by the hand of a cousin of the latter, a Mr.
Lyster. While he was explaining the object of his
visit, Fitzgerald rang the bell, and requested his
footman to bring him his cudgel ‘with the green
ribbon.’ This being brought, he walked up to his
cousin, and ferociously asked how <i>he</i> dared to deliver
such a message to <i>him</i>: then, not waiting for a reply,
he belaboured him most unmercifully, with such
violence indeed, as to break a diamond ring from off
his finger. When he considered him sufficiently
punished, he made him pick up his ring and present
it to him&mdash;but he did not keep it, he wrapped it up
in paper, and returned it, telling his cousin not to go
about swearing that he had robbed him of it.</p>

<p>Martin could get no satisfaction out of Fitzgerald
in Dublin, the object of the latter being to let his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
adversary have the reputation of being an insulted
man. But, afterwards, they met at Castlebar, and a
meeting was arranged. Martin was hit, and his
bullet struck Fitzgerald, but glanced off: according
to some it hit a button; according to others, Fitzgerald
was <i>plastron&eacute;</i>, or armoured.</p>

<p>His behaviour was more like that of a lunatic than
of a sane man. Take the following example, for instance.
He had a house and grounds near Dublin,
and his neighbours all fought shy of him&mdash;nay, one
of them, a retired officer, Captain Boulton, would
neither accept his invitations nor invite him to his
mansion. This conduct galled Fitzgerald, and he
devised a novel method of avenging himself of the
insult. He would shoot on the captain’s grounds
without leave. So he went down with his man and
dogs and began killing the game in fine style. This
soon brought out the steward, who began to remonstrate
with the trespasser. Fitzgerald’s answer was a
bullet, which whizzed close to the head of the poor
steward, who turned, and ran for his life, Fitzgerald
after him with a second gun, with the certain determination
of shooting him. Luckily the man got
safely into the mansion. Baffled of his victim, Fitzgerald
began abusing Captain Boulton, calling on
him to come out, and give him satisfaction for his
man’s behaviour. But the captain, not seeing the
force of the argument, refrained, and Fitzgerald fired
his gun at the dining-room window. As this, however,
did not bring out the captain, he fired at the
windows as fast as his man could load, and only left
off when he had smashed every one of them.</p>

<p>Another time he waged war against all the dogs in
Castlebar, shooting them whenever he got a chance;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
but the people did not stand it tamely; they rose,
visited his kennels, and shot his dogs.</p>

<p>His father died; but his brother, his father’s
mistress, and MacDonnell, took advantage of every
circumstance in their power to maliciously vex him.
Law-suits were stirred up against him, and had to
be met with the assistance of Timothy Brecknock,
who was Fitzgerald’s legal adviser, and the followers
of both parties were not particular in exchanging a
shot or two, one with the other.</p>

<p>At length MacDonnell kidnapped one of Fitzgerald’s
servants, and kept him prisoner for twenty
days. Then the man escaped, and Fitzgerald applied
for, and obtained warrants against, MacDonnell and
two other men, named Hipson and Gallagher. To
execute these warrants personally must have been a
congenial task to Fitzgerald, and he set out for that
purpose, followed by a large body of men. On their
approach, MacDonnell fled to the neighbouring village
of Ballivary, and his friends did the best they
could to defend themselves, firing on his party and
wounding six or seven of them. They then went
after MacDonnell, and, after more firing, succeeded
in apprehending MacDonnell, Hipson, and Gallagher.
These unfortunate men begged to be taken before
the nearest magistrate; but Fitzgerald had them
bound, and taken to his house, where they remained
all night.</p>

<p>Early the next morning they were sent, guarded
by a man of his, one Andrew Craig, and about
eighteen or twenty more, all well armed, to be
examined by the magistrates. Before their departure
Fitzgerald gave the guard strict instructions to kill
the prisoners should they attempt to escape. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
they had gone about three-quarters of a mile a shot
was fired, and one of the escort was laid low. But
very little was wanted to rouse their wild blood, and
it was at once considered that a rescue was intended.
Remembering the instructions given them by Fitzgerald,
they fired on their prisoners, killing Hipson,
who fell into a ditch, dragging Gallagher with him,
wounded with three bullets in his arm. MacDonnell,
by the same volley, had both his arms broken, but
he was soon afterwards despatched. Gallagher was
then discovered, and they were about to kill him, only
Fitzgerald ordered him to be taken to his house.</p>

<p>News was sent to Castlebar of what had taken
place, and Fitzgerald calmly awaited the result.
Fully aware of the dangerous character they had to
deal with, the authorities sent a large body, both of
regular troops, and volunteers, to Turlough, and these
were accompanied by an immense mob of people.
What happened is best related in the following
graphic account:</p>

<p>‘Brecknock was for remaining, as with the calmness
of conscious innocence, and boldly demanding a
warrant against Gallagher and others. This opinion,
however, did not agree with Fitzgerald’s own, who
justly dreaded the fury of the volunteers and the
populace, with whom MacDonnell had been so
popular. Neither did it coincide with that of the
Rev. Mr. Henry, the Presbyterian clergyman of Turlough,
who had been latterly a resident in the house,
and was now wringing his hands in wild alarm for
what had occurred. This gentleman’s horse was at
the door, and he strongly urged George Robert to
mount, and ride for his life out of the country altogether,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
till the powerful intercession he could command
might be made for him. In compliance with
this advice, which entirely coincided with his own
opinion, it is stated that he made several attempts to
mount; but that, splendid horseman as he was,
whether through nervous excitement, guilty terror, or
the restiveness of the animal, he was unable to attain
the saddle, and, in consequence, obliged to fly into
the house again, as the military were announced to
be approaching near. It is also generally asserted
that the Rev. Mr. Ellison, who headed the soldiers,
sent them on to Gurth-na-fullagh, without halting
them at Turlough, where he himself stopped.</p>

<p>‘Were this circumstance even true, however, Fitzgerald
gained but a short respite by it, as the
volunteers, with many of the populace, came furiously
up immediately after; and, some of them being
placed about the house, the remainder entered to
search and pillage it. Brecknock and Fulton were
immediately captured, but, after ransacking every
corner and crevice more than once without finding
him, the volunteers were beginning to think that
Fitzgerald must have effected his escape before their
arrival, when one of them, forcing open a clothes-chest
in a lower apartment, discovered him among
a heap of bed-clothes in his place of concealment.</p>

<p>‘“What do you want, you ruffian?” he said, on
finding himself detected.</p>

<p>‘“To dhrag ye, like a dog’s head, to a bonfire,” replied
another volunteer, named Morran, a powerful
man, who seized him at the same time by the breast,
and drew him forth by main force.</p>

<p>‘A pistol was now presented at him by a third to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
take summary vengeance; but a comrade snapped it
from his hands, asking if there was not murder
enough already.</p>

<p>‘“What mercy did himself or his murdherers show
to those every way their betthers?”</p>

<p>‘“Well, let them pay for that on the gallows, but
let us be no murdherers; let us give him up to the
law.”</p>

<p>‘He was, accordingly, hauled out to the front of
the house, where, perceiving Mr. Ellison, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>‘“Ellison, will you allow me to be handled thus by
such rabble?”</p>

<p>‘Mr. Ellison’s response to this saved him from
further molestation for a time, and exertions were
then made to withdraw the pillagers from the wholesale
plundering they were practising within. One
fellow had girded his loins with linen almost as fine
as Holland&mdash;so fine that he made some hundred yards
fit round his body without being much observable.
Another, among other valuables, made himself master
of the duellist’s diamond-buttoned coat; while a
third contrived to appropriate to himself all the
jewels, valued at a very high amount. In short, so
entire were the spoliation and destruction that, before
sunset, not a single pane of glass was left in the
windows.</p>

<p>‘The remainder of those implicated in the murders
were speedily apprehended, except Craig, who
escaped for the time, but was taken soon after near
Dublin.</p>

<p>‘We must now pause to sustain our character as
an accurate chronicler to relate an act as unprecedented,
as lawless, and as terrible as the most terrible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
of Fitzgerald’s own. He was alone, on the night of
his capture, in the room assigned to him in the gaol.
It was not a felon’s apartment, but was guarded on
the outside by two armed soldiers, lest he should
make any desperate attempt to escape. It was some
hours after nightfall that Clarke, the then sub-sheriff,
removed one of those sentinels to another portion of
the prison, where he stated he required his presence.
They had scarcely disappeared, when the remaining
soldier, McBeth (according to his own account), was
knocked down, and his musket taken from him, while
the door was burst open, and a number of men, all
armed with pistols, sword-canes, and the sentinel’s
musket, commenced a furious and deadly attack on
Fitzgerald, who, though totally unarmed, made a
most extraordinary defence. Several shots were discharged
rapidly at him, one of which lodged in his
thigh, while another broke a ring on the finger of
one of his hands, which he put up to change the
direction of the ball.</p>

<p>He was then secured by John Gallagher, one of
the assailants, and a powerful man, and, whilst
struggling in his grip, thrust at with blades and
bayonets, one of the former of which broke in the
fleshy part of his arm. The latter, too, in forcing out
two of his teeth, had its point broken, and was
thereby prevented from passing through his throat.
After having freed himself, by great exertions, from
Gallagher’s grasp, he was next assaulted with musket-stock,
pistol-butts, and the candlestick, which had
been seized by one of the assailants, who gave the
candle to a boy to hold. By one of the blows inflicted
by these weapons he was prostrated under
the table, and, while lying there, defending himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
with unimpaired powers against other deadly-aimed
blows, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>‘Cowardly rascals, you may now desist; you
have done for me, which was, of course, your object.’</p>

<p>The candle had by this time been quenched in
the struggling, and the gaol and streets thoroughly
alarmed, so that the assailants, fearing to injure one
another, and deeming that their intended victim was
really dispatched, retreated from the prison, leaving
Fitzgerald, though wounded, once more in security.</p>

<p>In consequence of this outrage, his trial was postponed
for two months, and the government ordered
his assailants to be prosecuted, but on trial they were
acquitted. Fitzgerald himself was tried the same
day (June 8, 1786), the chief witnesses against him
being his own man, Andrew Craig, and Andrew
Gallagher, the latter of whom deposed that when he,
Hipson, and MacDonnell, were confined in Fitzgerald’s
house, there was a pane broken in the
window, and ‘At day he saw a number of men
regularly drawn up, to the number of twenty or
thirty. He saw Andrew Craig and James Foy
settling them. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Brecknock
came to the flag of the hall-door; through the broken
pane he heard them conversing; they spoke in
French for some time, and afterwards in English,
but he could not hear what they said, but the names
of himself, MacDonnell, and Hipson were severally
mentioned. He heard at that time nothing more
than their names. Mr. Fitzgerald called over James
Foy and Andrew Craig, who were settling the guard,
and ordered them to move a little higher, about ten
or twelve yards above the house. There was some
other conversation which he did not hear. As soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
as the guard were settled, Mr. Fitzgerald gave them&mdash;Foy
and Craig&mdash;orders “If they saw any rescue,
or colour of a rescue, be sure they shot the prisoners,
and take care of them.”</p>

<p>‘When these orders were given, Mr. Fitzgerald said
to Mr. Brecknock,</p>

<p>‘“Ha! we shall soon get rid of them now.”</p>

<p>‘Mr. Brecknock replied: “Oh, then we shall be easy
indeed.”</p>

<p>‘After the guard was settled, Mr. Fitzgerald called
back Andrew Craig, and when Craig came within
ten yards of him, he, Mr. Fitzgerald, said,</p>

<p>‘“Andrew, be sure you kill them. Do not let one of
the villains escape.”</p>

<p>‘Andrew answered: “Oh, never fear, please your
honour.”’</p>

<p>At his trial he had a bitter enemy both in the judge,
Yelverton, and the prosecuting counsel, Fitzgibbon.
Nor could he reckon the high sheriff, Denis Browne,
among his friends, so that it was scarcely possible that
it should have but one issue, and the jury returned a
verdict of guilty against both him and Brecknock, and
the judge sentenced them to immediate execution.
Fitzgerald begged for a little delay, so that he might
settle his worldly affairs; it was denied him, and, at
six in the evening, he walked forth to his doom.
Brecknock had already suffered. Fitzgerald dreaded
the scene of the scaffold and the journey thither along
the high road, in a cart, and asked, as a last favour
from the sheriff, to be allowed to walk and go by a
by-way. It was granted, and he went to his doom
preceded by the hangman, who wore a large mask.
He walked very fast, and was dressed in a ragged
coat of the Castletown hunt, a dirty flannel waistcoat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
and drawers, both of which were without buttons,
brown worsted or yarn stockings, a pair of coarse
shoes without buckles, and an old round hat, tied
round with a pack-thread band.</p>

<p>When he jumped off the ladder the rope broke,
although he was but a slightly-built man and a light
weight, and he had to wait until another, and a
stronger, one was procured. After forty minutes’
hanging his body was cut down, and was waked by
the light of a few candles in a barn at Turlough;
it was interred, the next morning, in the family tomb,
situated in a ruined chapel adjoining a round tower,
but his remains were disturbed some years afterwards
at the burial of his brother in the same tomb. He was
thirty-eight years of age.</p>

<p>His daughter had a portion of &pound;10,000 left her by
him, and she was a very gentle and interesting girl.
She mostly resided with her uncle at Castletown, and
was unaware, for a long time, of her father’s fate.
But it so happened that, being one day alone in the
library, and looking over the upper shelves, she lit
upon a copy of his trial. She read it, and from that
time never lifted up her head, nor smiled&mdash;she could
not bear her position as the daughter of a felon, and
she gradually pined away, and died at an early age.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Pugnacity</span> is not confined to the male
sex, as everyone well knows, and none
better than the police-force, but in these
latter and, presumably, degenerate days,
the efforts, in this direction, of the softer
sex are confined to social exhibitions, there being, as
far as is known, no woman serving in Her Majesty’s
force either by land or by sea. Indeed, with the
present medical examination, it would be impossible;
and so it would have been in the old days, only then
all was fish that came to the net. His, or Her
Majesty, as the case might be, never had enough
men, and ‘food for powder’ was ever acceptable, and
its quality never closely scrutinised. It is incredible,
were it not true, that these women, whose stories I
am about to relate, were not discovered to be such&mdash;they
were wounded, they were flogged, and yet
there was no suspicion as to their sex.</p>

<p>We get the particulars of the life of the first of that
century’s Amazons in a book of one hundred and eighty-one
pages, published (second edition) in 1744, entitled,
‘The British Heroine: or, an Abridgment of the Life and
Adventures of Mrs. Christian Davis, commonly called
Mother Ross.’ She was born in Dublin, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1667,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
and was the daughter of a maltster and brewer, named
Cavanagh, who occupied a small farm about two
miles from Dublin. Here Miss Christian resided with
her mother, and, although her education was not
neglected, for she learned to read and sew, yet the
charms of physical exertion were more attractive, and
she took greater delight in using the flail, or following
the plough, than in sedentary occupations. She was a
regular tomboy, bestriding bare-backed horses and,
without saddle or bridle, scampering about, taking
hedges and ditches whenever they came in her way.</p>

<p>After the abdication of James II. her father sold all
his standing corn, &amp;c., and with the produce, and the
money he had by him, he raised a troop of horse and
joined the king’s army. He was wounded at the
battle of Aghrim, and soon afterwards died of fever.
His wife had very prudently negotiated a pardon for
him, but, as soon as he was dead, the government
confiscated all his goods; yet still the mother and
daughter managed to get along somehow or other.</p>

<p>She grew up to be a buxom and sprightly lass,
when it was her misfortune to meet with her cousin,
the Reverend Thomas Howell, a Fellow of Dublin
University, who first seduced and then abandoned
her. Her grief at this told upon her health, and her
mother sent her for a change of air to Dublin, there to
stop with an aunt, who kept a public-house. With
her she lived for four years, when her aunt died and
left her all she had, including the business. She
afterwards married a servant of her aunt’s, one Richard
Welch, and lived very happily with him for four
years, when her husband one day went out, with
fifty pounds in his pocket, to pay his brewer, and
never returned.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>For nearly twelve months she heard no tidings of
him, but one day came a letter, in which he told her
he had met a friend, and with him had too much
drink, went on board ship, and had more drink; and
when he recovered from the effects of his debauch,
found himself classed as a recruit for his Majesty’s
army, sailing for Helvoetsluys. The receipt of this
letter completely upset his wife, but only for a short
time, when she took the extraordinary resolution of
entering the army as a recruit, in order that she
might be sent to Flanders, and there might possibly
meet with her husband. She let her house, left her
furniture in charge of her neighbours, sent one child
to her mother’s, and put the other out to nurse. She
then cut her hair short, put on a suit of her husband’s
clothes, hat and wig, and buckled on a silver-hilted
sword. There was a law then in existence by which
it was an offence to carry out of the kingdom any
sum exceeding five pounds, but this she evaded by
quilting fifty guineas in the waistband of her breeches.</p>

<p>She then enlisted in a foot regiment under the
name of Christopher Welch, and was soon shipped,
with other recruits, and sent to Holland. She was,
with the others, put through some sort of drill, but
much time could not then be wasted on drill, and
then they were sent to the grand army, and incorporated
in different regiments. Almost directly after
joining, she was wounded by a musket-ball in the leg,
at the battle of Landen, and had to quit the field.
This wound laid her up for two months, and when
she rejoined her regiment they were ordered into
winter quarters. Here she, in common with the
other British soldiers, helped the Dutch to repair
their dykes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>In the following campaign she had the ill-luck to
be taken prisoner by the French, and was sent to
St. Germains en Laye, where Mary of Modena, the
wife of James II. paid particular attention to the
wants of the English prisoners, having them separated
from the Dutch, and allowing each man five
farthings for tobacco, a pound of bread, and a pint
of wine daily. She was imprisoned for nine days,
when an exchange of prisoners took place, and she
was released.</p>

<p>Once more the troops went into winter quarters,
and Mrs. Welch must needs ape the gallantry of her
comrades. She made fierce love to the daughter of
a rich burgher, and succeeded so well that the girl
would fain have married her. Now it so happened
that a sergeant of the same regiment loved the same
girl, but with other than honourable intentions, and
one day he endeavoured to gain her compliance by
force. The girl resisted and in the scuffle got nearly
all the clothes torn off her back. When Mrs. Welch
heard of this affair she ‘went for’ that sergeant, and
the result was a duel with swords. Mrs. Welch received
two wounds in her right arm, but she nearly
killed the sergeant, and afterwards, dreading his
animosity when he should have recovered, she exchanged
into a dragoon regiment (Lord John Hayes)
and was present at the taking of Namur.</p>

<p>When the troops again went into winter quarters
a curious adventure befell her, which goes to prove
how completely masculine was her appearance. She
resisted the advances of a woman, who thereby was
so angered that she swore she would be revenged,
and accordingly, when a child was born to her, she
swore that the trooper, Christopher Welch, was its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
father. This, of course, could have been easily disproved,
but then good-bye to her hopes of meeting
with her husband; so, after mature deliberation, she
accepted the paternity of the child, who, however,
did not trouble her for long, as it died in a month.</p>

<p>After the peace of Ryswick in 1697, the army was
partially disbanded, and Mrs. Welch returned home to
Dublin. She found her mother, children, and friends
all well, but finding that she was unrecognized,
owing to her dress and the hardships of campaigning,
she did not make herself known, but re-enlisted in
1701 in her old regiment of dragoons, on the breaking
out of the War of Succession. She went through
the campaigns of 1702 and 1703, and was present at
many of the engagements therein, receiving a wound
in the hip, at Donawert, and, although attended by
three surgeons, her sex was not discovered. She
never forgot her quest, but all her inquiries after her
husband were in vain. Yet she unexpectedly came
upon him, after the battle of Hochstadt in 1704,
caressing and toying with a Dutch camp-follower.
A little time afterwards she discovered herself to him.
Having seen what she had, she would not return
to her husband as his wife, but passed as a long-lost
brother, and they met frequently.</p>

<p>At the battle of Ramilies, in 1705, a piece of a
shell struck the back of her head, and fractured her
skull, for which she underwent the operation of trepanning,
and then it was, whilst unconscious, that her
sex was discovered, and her husband came forward
and claimed her as his wife. Her pay went on until
she was cured, when the officers of the regiment,
who, naturally, were interested in this very romantic
affair, made up a new wardrobe for her, and she was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
re-married to her husband with great solemnity, and
many and valuable were her marriage-presents. She
could not be idle, so she turned sutler, and, by the
indulgence of the officers, she was allowed to pitch
her tent in the front, whilst all the others were sent
to the rear, but she was virtually unsexed by the
rough ways of the camp, although a child was born
to her amongst the din and confusion of the campaign.</p>

<p>Her husband was killed at the battle of Malplaquet,
in 1709, and then this rough woman could not help
showing that she possessed some of the softer feelings
of her sex. Her grief was overpowering. She
bit a great piece out of her arm, tore her hair, and
then threw herself upon the corpse in an ecstasy of
passion, and, had any weapon been handy, she would,
undoubtedly, have killed herself. With her own
hands she dug his grave, and with her own hands
would she have scraped the earth away, in order to
get one more glimpse of her husband’s face, had she
not been prevented. She refused food; she became
absolutely ill from grief, and yet, within eleven weeks
from her husband’s death, she married a grenadier
named Hugh Jones! Her second married life was
brief&mdash;for her husband was mortally wounded at the
siege of St. Venant.</p>

<p>After her husband’s death, she got a living by
cooking for the officers, and went through the whole
campaign, till 1712, when she applied to the Duke
of Ormond for a pass to England&mdash;which he not
only gave her, but also money enough to defray
her expenses on the way. On her arrival in England,
she called on the Duke of Marlborough, to
see whether he could not get some provision made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
for her; but he was not in power, and, however
good his will towards her might have been, he had
not the means. She then tried the Duke of Argyle,
who advised her to have a petition to the Queen
drawn up, and take it to the Duke of Hamilton,
and he himself would back it up.</p>

<p>She did so, and took it to the duke, who, when
he was assured she was no impostor, advised her
to get a new petition drawn up, and present herself
to the Queen. So, the next day, she dressed herself
in her best, and went to Court, waiting patiently
at the foot of the great staircase, and when Queen
Anne, supported by the Duke of Argyle, came down,
she dropped on one knee, and presented her petition
to the Queen, who received it with a smile, and bade
her rise and be of good cheer, for that she would
provide for her; and, perceiving her to be with child,
she added, ‘If you are delivered of a boy, I will give
him a commission as soon as he is born.’ Her Majesty
also ordered her fifty pounds, to defray the expenses
of her lying-in. She lived some little time in London,
being helped very materially by the officers to
whom she was known; and it was during this time,
on Saturday morning, the 15th of November, 1712,
she was going through Hyde Park, and was an eye-witness
of the historical duel between Lord Mohun
and the Duke of Hamilton.</p>

<p>A natural longing came upon her to see her
mother and her children, and she wrote to her to
say she would be in Dublin by a certain date. The
old woman, although over a hundred years of age,
trudged the whole ten miles to Dublin, to see this
daughter whom she had so long given up as dead;
and the meeting was very affecting. When she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
came to inquire after her children, she found one
had died at the age of eighteen, and the other was
in the workhouse, where it had very speedily been
placed by the nurse in whose charge it had been
left. She went to look after the furniture and goods
which she had housed with her neighbours; but
there was only one who would give any account of
them. A man had taken possession of her freehold
house, and refused to give it up; and, having lost
the title-deeds, she could not force him, besides which
she had no money to carry on a lawsuit.</p>

<p>These misfortunes did not dishearten her; she
always had been used to victualling. So she took a
public-house, and stocked it, and made pies, and
altogether was doing very well, when she must needs
go and marry a soldier named Davies, whose discharge
she bought, but he afterwards enlisted in the
Guards.</p>

<p>Queen Anne, besides her gift of fifty pounds,
ordered Mrs. Davies a shilling a day for life, which
Harley, Earl of Oxford, for some reason or other,
cut down to fivepence, with which she was fain
to be content until a change of ministry took place.
Then she applied to Mr. Craggs, and she got her
original pension restored.</p>

<p>She did not do very well in her business, but she
found plenty of friends in the officers of the Army
who knew her. She once more bought her husband’s
discharge, and got him into Chelsea Hospital,
with the rank of sergeant. She also was received
into that institution; and there she died on the 7th
of July, 1739, and was interred in the burying-ground
attached to Chelsea Hospital, with military honours.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hannah Snell’s</span> grandfather entered the Army in
the reign of William III. as a volunteer, and, by his
personal bravery, he earned a commission as lieutenant,
with the rank of captain. He was wounded
at Blenheim, and mortally wounded at Malplaquet.
Her brother was also a soldier, and was killed at
Fontenoy; so that she may be said to have come
of a martial race. Her father was a hosier and dyer,
and she was born at Worcester on St. George’s Day,
23rd of April, 1723.</p>

<p>According to a contemporary biography of her,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
‘Hannah, when she was scarce Ten Years of Age,
had the seeds of Heroinism, as it were, implanted
in her nature, and she used often to declare to her
Companions that she would be a Soldier, if she lived;
and, as a preceding Testimony of the Truth, she
formed a Company of young Soldiers among her
Playfellows, and of which she was chief Commander,
at the Head of whom she often appeared, and was
used to parade the whole City of Worcester. This
Body of young Volunteers were admired all over
the Town, and they were styled young “Amazon
Snell’s Company”; and this Martial Spirit grew up
with her, until it carried her through the many
Scenes and Vicissitudes she encountered for nigh
five Years.’</p>

<p>Her father and mother being dead, she, in 1740,
moved to London, where she arrived on Christmas
Day, and took up her abode with one of her sisters,
who had married a carpenter named Gray, and was
living at Wapping. Two years afterwards she was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
married, at the Fleet, to a German or Dutch sailor
named James Summs, on the 6th of January, 1743;
but he was a worthless fellow, and as soon as he
found she was with child by him, having spent all her
money, he deserted her. She heard of his death
subsequently; he was at Genoa, and, in a quarrel, he
killed a Genoese. For this he was condemned to
death, sewn up in a sack with a quantity of stones,
and sunk in the sea. Her child survived its birth but
seven months, and she was left a free woman.</p>

<p>Up to this time her story presents nothing of
particular interest; but, like ‘Long Meg of Westminster,’
she was a <i>virago</i>, more man than woman,
and, with the hope of some day meeting with her
husband, she donned male attire, and set forth on her
quest. She soon fell in with a recruiting party at
Coventry, whither she had walked, and where she
found her funds exhausted. A little drink, the acceptance
of a shilling, a visit to a magistrate, were the
slight preliminaries to her military career, and the
27th of November, 1743, found her a private in the
army of King George II. The guinea, and five
shillings, her little ‘bounty money,’ had to follow the
fate of all similar sums, in treating her comrades.
There was scant time for drills, and she was, after
about three weeks’ preparation, drafted off to Carlisle
to join her regiment. There were no railway passes
in those days, so the weary march northward took
twenty-two days.</p>

<p>She had not been long in Carlisle before her sergeant,
named Davis, requested her aid in an intrigue
he was endeavouring to establish with a young
woman of that town; but, instead of helping him, she
warned the young person of his intentions, and absolutely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
won the girl’s heart. Davis’s jealousy was
excited, and to punish Jemmy Gray (which was the
name under which Hannah Snell had enlisted), he
reported her for some neglect of duty, and, as commanding
officers then were rather severe than lenient
in their punishments, she was sentenced to receive
six hundred lashes, five hundred of which she absolutely
received, and would have taken the whole had
not some officers interfered. It seems marvellous that
her sex, when she was tied up and partially stripped,
was not discovered, and in a romance it would be a
weak spot; but, as a matter-of-fact, no one suspected
she was a woman, and when her back was healed she
returned to her duty. Flogging was common enough
in those days.</p>

<p>But a worse danger of exposure threatened her, for
a fellow-townsman from Worcester enlisted in the
same regiment, and so she determined to desert. The
female friend on whose account she had suffered such
severe punishment, found some money, and Hannah
Snell fled towards Portsmouth, surreptitiously changing
coats in a field by the way. She stopped but
little time in Portsmouth, and then she enlisted in
the Marines, in which corps she was certain to be
sent abroad on service, and might have greater
opportunities of meeting with her husband.</p>

<p>Scarce three weeks after her enlistment had elapsed
when a draft was made to join Admiral Boscawen’s
fleet for the East Indies, and she was sent on board
the sloop of war, the <i>Swallow</i>. Here she soon became
very popular with her mess-mates, her skill in
cooking, washing, and mending their shirts made her
a general favourite, and she did her duty with the
best of her comrades, being especially noted for her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
smartness, so much so, indeed, that she was made an
officer’s servant.</p>

<p>Those old ships were not very good sailors in a
gale. The French beat us hollow at ship-building,
and we much improved by studying the make of the
prizes we were constantly taking, so it is not to be
wondered at if that rolling old tub, the <i>Swallow</i>, came
to grief. The marvel would have been had it not
occurred. Twice, before the Cape was made, they
had to repair and refit. They were then ordered to
the Mauritius, and eventually they went to the Coromandel
coast, where they landed and laid siege to
and took Areacopong. They then besieged Pondicherry
(in September, 1748); but that town was not
fated to fall into the hands of the British until 1760.
In all the hardships of the siege Hannah Snell bore
her full part, fording rivers breast high, sleeping in
and working at the trenches, &amp;c., until at last she
was desperately wounded, receiving six shots in her
right leg, five in her left, and a bullet in her groin.
Anyone would think that thus wounded, and in
hospital, her sex would have been discovered; but it
was not. She managed to extract the ball from her
groin, and with the connivance of an old black nurse,
she always dressed the wound herself, so that the
surgeons did not know of its existence.</p>

<p>Three months she lay in hospital, going back to
her duty as a Marine on her discharge. But her
comrades bantered her on her somewhat feminine
appearance, her smooth cheeks not being in accordance
with her age. Besides, she was somewhat
quiet, and different from the rollicking Jack Tars by
whom she was surrounded, and so she earned the
name of Miss Molly Gray. A continuance of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
quiet <i>r&ocirc;le</i> might have led to discovery, so when they
came to Lisbon, and the ‘liberty men’ went on shore,
she was as racketty as any of them, and ‘Miss Molly’
was soon lost, and in her place was ‘Hearty Jemmy.’
From Lisbon they sailed for home, and on her
arrival at Spithead, she was either discharged, or sent
on furlough; at all events, there ended her military
and naval career, for she went straight to her sister
at Wapping, and was at once recognized.</p>

<p>Campaigning had made her restless, and, although
many of the officers who had known her assisted her
pecuniarily, it was light come, light go, and the
money was soon spent. So her friends advised her
to petition the Duke of Cumberland, pointing out her
services, and also dilating upon her wounds. On the
16th of June, 1750, she found a very favourable
opportunity of presenting her memorandum to the
duke, and, after full inquiry, she was awarded a
pension of a shilling a day. This, however, would
not keep her, and finding that, as an Amazon, she
had a market value, she engaged with the proprietor
of the New Wells in Goodman’s Fields (the Royalty
Theatre, Wellclose Square) to appear on the stage
as a soldier. In this character she sang several
songs, and ‘She appears regularly dress’d in her
Regimentals from Top to Toe, with all the Accoutrements
requisite for the due Performance of her
Military Exercises. Here she and her Attendants fill
up the Stage in a very agreeable Manner. The tabor
and Drum give Life to her March, and she traverses
the stage two or three times over, Step by Step, in
the same Manner as our Soldiers march on the Parade
in St. James’s Park.</p>

<p>‘After the Spectators have been sufficiently amused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
with this formal Procession, she begins her Military
exercises, and goes through the whole Catechism (if I
may be allowed the Expression) with so much Dexterity
and Address, and with so little Hesitation or
Default, that great Numbers even of Veteran Soldiers,
who have resorted to the Wells out of mere curiosity
only, have frankly acknowledged that she executes
what she undertakes to Admiration, and that the
universal Applause which she meets with is by no
means the Result of Partiality to her in Consideration
of her Sex, but is due to her, without Favour or Affection,
as the Effect of her extraordinary Merit.</p>

<p>‘As our Readers may be desirous of being informed
in what Dress she now appears, we think it proper to
inform them that she wears Men’s Cloaths, being, as
she says, determined so to do, and having bought
new Cloathing for that Purpose.’</p>

<p>This theatrical performance, of course, could not
last long; so, with her savings, she took a public-house
at Wapping, which she christened ‘The Widow
in Masquerade,’ and on one side of the sign she was
delineated in her full regimentals, on the other in
plain clothes.</p>

<p>She afterwards married, for in the <i>Universal
Chronicle</i> (November <sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub>, 1759, p. 359, col. 3)
may be read: ‘Marriages. At Newbury, in the
county of Berks, the famous Hannah Snell, who
served as a marine in the last war, and was wounded
at the siege of Pondicherry, to a carpenter of that
place.’ His name was Eyles. In 1789 she became
insane, and was taken to Bethlehem, where she died
on the 8th of February, 1792, aged sixty-nine.</p>

<p>The examples quoted of women joining the army
are by no means singular, for in 1761 a lynx-eyed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
sergeant detected a woman who wished to enlist
under the name of Paul Daniel, in the hope that she
might be sent to Germany, where her husband was
then serving in the army. And in the same year a
woman named Hannah Witney was masquerading at
Plymouth in man’s attire, and was laid hold of by a
press-gang and lodged in Plymouth gaol. She was
so disgusted at the treatment she received that she
disclosed her sex, at the same time telling the astonished
authorities that she had served as a marine for
five years.</p>

<p>There is a curious little chap-book, now very rare,
of the ‘Life and Adventures of Maria Knowles ...
by William Fairbank, Sergeant-major of the 66th
Regiment of Foot,’ and, as it is very short, it may be
as well to give its <i>ipsissima verba</i>.</p>

<p>‘The heroine of the following story is the only
daughter of Mr. John Knowles, a reputed farmer,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> of
the parish of Bridworth, in the county of Cheshire,
where Maria was born, and was her father’s only
daughter. At an early age she lost her mother, and
was brought up under the care of a mother-in-law,
who treated her with more kindness than is usually
done to motherless children. Her father having no
other child, his house might have proved a comfortable
home for one of a more sober disposition. At
the age of nineteen she was so very tall that she was
styled the ‘Tall Girl.’ She had a very handsome face,
which gained her plenty of sweethearts. Many
young men felt the weight of her fists for giving her
offences. She refused many offers of marriage, and
that from persons of fortune.</p>

<p>‘Being one day at the market in Warrington, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
saw one Cliff, a sergeant of the Guards on the recruiting
service, with whom she fell deeply in love;
he in a short time was called to join the regiment,
and she, not being able to bear her love-sick passion,
eloped from her father’s house, immediately went up
to London, disguised in man’s apparel, and enlisted
in the same regiment with her sweetheart, in which
she made a most martial appearance in her regimentals;
her height covered the deception. As a red
coat captivates the fair sex, our female soldier made
great advances, being a lover of mirth and a smart
girl....</p>

<p>‘A part of the Guards were ordered to Holland,
with whom sailed Maria and her sweetheart. The
British troops were stationed at Dort, and a party
was sent in gunboats to annoy the French, who were
then besieging Williamstadt. From Holland they
were ordered to French Flanders, where Maria was
at several desperate battles and sieges. At Dunkirk
she was wounded in three different parts, in her right
shoulder, in her right arm, and thigh, which discovered
her sex, and, of course, her secret.</p>

<p>‘After being recovered from her wounds, and questioned
by her commanding officer, she related to him
the particulars of her life, and the reason of her being
disguised, and entering for a soldier, which was to
seek her fortune, and share the fate of the man on
whom she had irrevocably fixed her affection.</p>

<p>‘The news soon reached her lover, who flew to the
arms of so faithful a girl, whom he embraced with
the most ardent zeal, vowing an eternal constancy to
her; and, in order to reward such faithful love, the
officers raised a handsome subscription for them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
after which they were married by the chaplain of the
regiment, to their great joy....</p>

<p>‘But this was not all, for the adjutant of the 66th
Regiment of Foot dying of his wounds, Sergeant Cliff
was promoted to that berth, and Sergeant Fairbank
to sergeant-major, as Cliff and him were always comrades
together. In a little time the regiment was
sent to Gibraltar, where they stayed most part of the
year, during which Mrs. Cliff was delivered of a fine
son, after which the regiment was sent to the West
Indies, and, after a passage of twenty-eight days,
landed safely on the island of St. Vincent, where
they remained some time; but, the yellow fever raging
among the troops, Mr. Cliff died, to the great
grief of his disconsolate wife and her young son.
She was still afraid of the raging distemper, but,
happily for her and her son, neither of them took it.</p>

<p>‘Great indulgence was given her, and also provisions
allowed them both; but this did not suffice,
for Mrs. Cliff, losing the man she had ventured her
life so many times for, was now very unhappy, and
made application to the commanding officer for her
passage to England; and a great many men, unfit
for duty, coming home, she was admitted a passenger.
I, being unfit to act as sergeant-major, on
account of a wound that I received in my left leg,
the same day Mrs. Cliff was wounded, and although it
was cured, as soon as I came into a hot country it
broke out again, and I, being unfit for duty, was sent
home, and recommended.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> So I came home in the
same ship, with this difference, that she was in the
cabin, and I among the men. We sailed in the
<i>Eleanor</i> on the 25th of January, 1798, and, after forty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
days’ sail, we reached Spithead, and, after performing
a short quarantine, we landed at Portsmouth on
the 16th of March, where I left Mrs. Cliff to pursue
her journey to her father’s, and I came to
London.’</p>

<p>I have been unable to trace the fate of this heroine
any further.</p>

<p>There is yet another woman of the eighteenth
century, who acted the part both of soldier and
sailor; and we read of her in the <i>Times</i>, 4th of
November, 1799.</p>

<p>‘There is at present in the Middlesex Hospital a
young and delicate female, who calls herself Miss
T&mdash;lb&mdash;t, and who is said to be related to some
families of distinction; her story is very singular:&mdash;At
an early period of her life, having been deprived,
by the villainy of a trustee, of a sum of money bequeathed
to her by a deceased relation of high rank,
she followed the fortunes of a young naval officer to
whom she was attached, and personated a common
sailor before the mast, during a cruise in the north
seas. In consequence of a lover’s quarrel she quitted
the ship, and assumed, for a time, the military
character; but her passion for the sea prevailing,
she returned to her favourite element, did good service,
and received a severe wound on board Earl St.
Vincent’s ship, on the glorious 14th of February,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> and
again bled in the cause of her country in the engagement
off Camperdown. On this last occasion her
knee was shattered, and an amputation is likely to
ensue. This spirited female, we understand, receives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
a pension of &pound;20 from an illustrious lady, which is
about to be doubled.’</p>

<p><i>Voil&agrave; comment on &eacute;crit l’histoire!</i> This newspaper
report is about as truthful as nine-tenths of the paragraphs
now-a-days; there is a substratum of truth,
but not ‘the whole truth and nothing but the truth.’
But this can be read in a little tractate entitled, ‘The
Life and Surprising Adventures of Mary Ann Talbot,
in the name of John Taylor. Related by herself.’
London, 1809. This pamphlet is extracted from
‘Kirby’s Wonderful Museum of Remarkable Characters,
&amp;c.,’ and professes to be an autobiography.
It is highly probable that it is so, as she was a
domestic servant in Mr. Kirby’s house for three years
before her death.</p>

<p>According to this relation she was the youngest of
sixteen natural children whom her mother had by
Lord William Talbot, Baron of Hensol, steward of
his Majesty’s household, and colonel of the Glamorganshire
Militia. She was born the 2nd of February,
1778, and her mother died on giving her birth. She
was put out to nurse in the country, until she was five
years of age, when she was placed in a boarding-school
at Chester, where she remained nine years,
being looked after by a married sister who lived at
Trevalyn, county Denbigh. At her death a man
named Sucker, living at Newport, county Salop, became
her guardian, and he behaved to her with such
severity that she cordially hated him. He introduced
her to a Captain Bowen, of the 82nd Regiment of Foot,
who took her to London in January, 1792, where,
friendless and alone, she soon became his victim.</p>

<p>His regiment was ordered to embark for Santo
Domingo, and he had so thoroughly subjugated her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
to his will, and she was so utterly helpless, that she
accompanied him on board as his ‘little foot page.’
Captain Bowen made John Taylor (for such was
the name Miss Talbot then took) thoroughly act up
to her assumed character, and she had to live and
mess with the lowest of the ship’s company, and,
what was more, had to do her turn of duty with the
ship’s crew.</p>

<p>After a stormy voyage, with short provisions, they
arrived at Port-au-Prince, but stayed there a very
short time, as orders came for them to return to
Europe, and join the troops on the Continent, under
the command of His Royal Highness the Duke of
York. Then it was that Captain Bowen made her
enrol herself as a drummer in his regiment, threatening
her unless she did so he would sell her up-country
for a slave. There was nothing for her but to comply,
so she put on the clothes and learned the business of
a drummer-boy, having, besides, still to be the drudge
of her paramour.</p>

<p>At the siege of Valenciennes she received two
wounds, neither of them severe enough to incapacitate
her from serving, and she cured them, without going
into hospital, with a little basilicon, lint, and Dutch
drops. In this siege Captain Bowen was killed, and
she, finding the key of his desk in his pocket, searched
the desk and found several letters relating to her,
from her quondam guardian, Sucker.</p>

<p>Being now released from her servitude, she began
to think of quitting the service, and, having changed
her military dress for one she had worn on ship-board,
she deserted, and, after some wandering, reached
Luxembourg, but, it being in the occupation of the
French, she was not permitted to go further. Being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
thus foiled in her design of reaching England, and
destitute of every necessary of life, she was compelled
to engage on board a French lugger, a cruiser. In
the course of their voyage, they fell in with the
British fleet under the command of Lord Howe. The
French vessel made a show of fighting, and John
Taylor refused to fight against her countrymen, for
which she received a severe thrashing from the
French captain.</p>

<p>After a very faint resistance the lugger was captured,
and she, as being English, was taken on board
the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> to be interrogated by Lord Howe.
Her story, being backed up by the French captain,
gained her release, and she was allowed to join the
navy, a berth being found for her on board the
<i>Brunswick</i> as powder-monkey, her duty being to hand
powder, &amp;c., for the guns when in action. Captain
Harvey, of the <i>Brunswick</i>, noticed the pseudo lad,
and straightly examined her as to whether she had
not run away from school, or if she had any friends;
but she disarmed his suspicions by telling him her
father and mother were dead, and she had not a
friend in the world; yet the kindly captain took such
a friendly interest in her that he made her principal
cabin-boy.</p>

<p>In the memorable fight off Brest, on the ‘Glorious
First of June,’ Captain Harvey was killed, and our
heroine severely wounded both in the ankle by a
grape-shot and in the thigh a little above the knee.
She was, of course, taken to the cockpit; but the
surgeon could not extract the ball in the ankle, and
would not venture to cut it out; nor, when they
arrived home, and she was taken to Haslar Hospital,
could they extract the ball. Partially cured, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
was discharged, and shipped on board the <i>Vesuvius</i>
bomb, belonging to Sir Sydney Smith’s squadron,
where she acted as midshipman, although she did
not receive the pay which should have accompanied
the position; and, while thus serving, a little anecdote
she tells give us a fair idea of what stuff she
was made.</p>

<p>‘It was necessary for some one on board to go to
the jib-boom to catch the jib-sheet, which in the gale
had got loose. The continual lungeing of the ship
rendered this duty particularly hazardous, and there
was not a seaman on board but rejected this office. I
was acting in the capacity of midshipman, though I
never received pay for my service in this ship but as
a common man. The circumstance I mention only
to show that it was not my particular duty to undertake
the task, which, on the refusal of several who
were asked, I voluntarily undertook. Indeed, the
preservation of us all depended on this exertion. On
reaching the jib-boom I was under the necessity of
lashing myself fast to it, for the ship every minute
making a fresh lunge, without such a precaution I
should inevitably have been washed away. The
surges continually breaking over me, I suffered an
uninterrupted wash and fatigue for six hours before I
could quit the post I occupied. When danger is
over, a sailor has little thought or reflection, and my
mess-mates, who had witnessed the perilous situation
in which I was placed, passed it off with a joke
observing, “that I had only been sipping sea broth”;
but it was a broth of a quality that, though most seamen
relish, yet few, I imagine, would like to take it
in the quantity I was compelled to do.’</p>

<p>By the fortune of war the <i>Vesuvius</i> was captured,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
and the crew were conveyed to Dunkirk, where they
were lodged in the prison of St. Clair, and the rigour
of their captivity seems to have been extreme, especially
in the case of Mary Anne Talbot, who perhaps
partially deserved it, as she attempted, in company
with a mess-mate, to escape. ‘We were both confined
in separate dungeons, where it was so dark that
I never saw daylight during the space of eleven
weeks, and the only allowance I received was bread
and water, let down to me from the top of the
cell. My bed consisted only of a little straw, not
more than half a truss, which was never changed.
For two days I was so ill in this dreadful place that
I was unable to stir from my wretched couch to
reach the miserable pittance, which, in consequence,
was drawn up in the same state. The next morning,
a person&mdash;who, I suppose, was the keeper of the
place&mdash;came into the dungeon without a light (which
way he came I know not, but I suppose through a
private door through which I afterwards passed to
be released), and called to me, “Are you dead?”
To this question I was only able to reply by requesting
a little water, being parched almost to death by
thirst, resulting from the fever which preyed on me.
He told me he had none, and left me in a brutal
manner, without offering the least relief. Nature
quickly restored me to health, and I sought the
bread and water with as eager an inclination as a
glutton would seek a feast. About five weeks after
my illness, an exchange of prisoners taking place, I
obtained my liberty.’</p>

<p>She then shipped to America as steward, and from
thence to England, and was going on a voyage to
the Mediterranean, when she was seized by a press-gang,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
and sent on board a tender. But she had
no wish to serve His Majesty at sea any more, and,
discovering her sex, she was examined by a surgeon,
and of course at once discharged.</p>

<p>Her little stock of money getting low, she applied
at the Navy pay-office, in Somerset House, for the
cash due to her whilst serving in the <i>Brunswick</i> and
<i>Vesuvius</i>, as well as her share of prize-money, arising
from her being present on the ‘glorious 1st of June.’
She was referred to a prize-agent, who directed her
to call again; this not being to her taste, she
returned to Somerset House, and indulged in very
rough language, for which she was taken off to
Bow Street. She told her story, and was ordered
to appear again, when a subscription was got up
in her behalf; and she was paid twelve shillings a
week, until she received her money from the Government.</p>

<p>Her old wound in the leg became bad again, and
she went into St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and on
her discharge, partially cured, she petitioned the
King and the Duke of York for relief. The latter
gave her five pounds. Then she cast about for the
means of earning a livelihood, and bethought her
that, when she was a prisoner at Dunkirk, she had
watched a German make little ornaments out of
gold-wire, which he sold at a good profit; and she
did the same, working at the shop of a jeweller in
St. Giles’s, and so expert was she that she made
the chains for a gold bracelet worn by Queen Charlotte.
But the old wound still broke out, and she
went into St. George’s Hospital for seven months.
When she came out, she led a shiftless, loafing existence,
always begging for money&mdash;of Mr. Dundas, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
the Duke of York, or anyone else that might possibly
be generous.</p>

<p>At last these kind friends got her case introduced
in the very highest quarters, and she kissed the
Queen’s hand at Buckingham House, as it was then
called; and soon afterwards she was directed to
apply at the War Office, in her sailor’s dress, to
receive a half-year’s payment of a pension the Queen
had granted her, in the name of John Taylor. Still
her wound kept breaking out, and twice she had
to go into Middlesex Hospital. She had some idea
of going on the stage, and performed several parts
at the Thespian Society in Tottenham Court Road,
but she gave it up, finding begging a more profitable
business; but even then she had to go to Newgate
for a small debt. She took in washing, but the
people did not pay her, and misfortune pursued her
everywhere.</p>

<p>One night, in September, 1804, she was thrown
from a coach into a hole left by the carelessness of
some firemen, in Church Lane, Whitechapel, and she
broke her arm, besides bruising herself badly. The
fire office would give her no compensation, but many
people were interested in her case, among them a
Mr. Kirby, a publisher in Paternoster Row, who
employed her as a domestic servant. In 1807, she
fell into a decline, doubtless induced by the very
free life she had led; and she died on the 4th of
February, 1808, having just completed her thirtieth
year.</p>

<p>It is not to be thought that England enjoyed the
monopoly of these viragos&mdash;the country of Jeanne
d’Arc was quite equal to the occasion, and Ren&eacute;e
Bordereau affords an illustration for the last century.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
She was born, of peasant parents, in 1770, at the
village of Soulaine, near Angers; and at the time
of the insurrection in La Vend&eacute;e, when the royalists
were so cruelly punished, she lost forty-two relations
in the struggle, her father being murdered before
her eyes.</p>

<p>This crushed out of her any soft and feminine
feelings she might have possessed, and she vowed
vengeance on the hated Republicans. She obtained
a musket, taught herself how to use it, learned some
elementary drill, and then, donning man’s attire,
joined the royalists. Among them she was known
by the name of Langevin, and where the fight was
fiercest, there she would be, and none suspected that
the daring trooper was a woman. On horseback,
and on foot, she fought in above two hundred battles
and skirmishes, frequently wounded, but seldom
much hurt. Such was the terror with which she
inspired the Bonapartists, that, when the rebellion
was put down, Napoleon specially exempted Langevin
from pardon, and she languished in prison
until the Restoration. She died in 1828.

<h2 id="THE_TIMES_AND_ITS_FOUNDER">THE ‘TIMES’ AND ITS FOUNDER.</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/a.jpg" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A discursive</span> book anent the eighteenth
century, as this is, would be incomplete
without a mention of one of the greatest
powers which it produced. This marvellous
newspaper, whose utterances, at
one time, exercised a sensible influence over the whole
of the civilised world, and which, even now, is the
most potent of all the English press, was founded by
Mr. John Walter, on January 1, 1788.</p>

<p>This gentleman was born either in 1738 or 1739,
and his father followed the business of a ‘coal buyer,’
which meant that he bought coals at the pit’s mouth,
and then shipped them to any desired port, or market.
In those days almost all coals came, by sea, from
Newcastle, and its district, because of the facility of
carriage; the great inland beds being practically unworked,
and in many cases utterly unknown: it being
reserved for the giant age of steam to develop their
marvellous resources.</p>

<p>His father died in 1755, John Walter then being
seventeen and, boy though he was, he at once succeeded
to his father’s business. In it he was diligent and
throve well, and he so won the confidence and
respect of his brother ‘coal buyers’ that when a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
larger Coal Exchange was found necessary, in order to
accommodate, and keep pace with its increasing business,
the whole of the arrangements, plans, and directions
were left in his hands. When the building was
completed, he was rewarded by his brethren in trade
with the position of manager, and afterwards he
became Chairman to the Body of Coal Buyers.</p>

<p>He married, and, in 1771, things had gone so prosperously
with him that he bought a house with some
ground at Battersea Rise, and here he lived, and
reared his family of six children, until his bankruptcy,
when it was sold. He also took unto himself partners,
and was the head of the firm of Walter, Bradley, and
Sage. For some time all went well, but competition
arose, and the old-fashioned way of doing business
could not hold its own against the keenness, and cutting,
of the new style. Let us hear him tell his own
story.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>‘I shall forbear relating the various scenes of business
I was engaged in prior to my embarking in
Lloyd’s Rooms; sufficient it is to remark that a very
extensive trade I entered into at the early age of
seventeen, when my father died, rewarded a strong
spirit of industry, and, for the first ten or twelve years,
with a satisfactory increase of fortune; but a number
of inconsiderable dealers, by undermining the fair
trader, and other dishonourable practices, reduced the
profits, and made them inadequate to the risque and
capital employed. It happened unfortunately for me,
about that time, some policy brokers, who had large
orders for insurances on foreign Indiamen and other
adventures, found their way to the Coal Market, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
building of which I was the principal planner and
manager.</p>

<p>‘I was accustomed, with a few others, to underwrite
the vessels particularly employed in that trade, and
success attended the step, because the risque was
fair, and the premiums adequate. This was my temptation
for inclining to their solicitations of frequenting
Lloyd’s Rooms.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> With great reluctance I complain
that I quitted a trade where low art and cunning
combated the fair principles of commerce, which my
mind resisted as my fortune increased; but from the
change I had to encounter deception and fraud, in a
more dangerous but subtle degree.</p>

<p>‘The misfortunes of the war were of great magnitude
to the Underwriters, but they were considerably
multiplied by the villainy and depravity of Mankind.
In the year 1776, at a time when they received only
peace premiums, American privateers swarmed on
the seas, drove to desperation by the Boston port act
passing at the close of the preceding year, to prohibit
their fisheries, and our trade fell a rapid prey before
government had notice to apply the least protection.
Flushed with success, it increased the number of
their armed vessels, and proved such a source of
riches as enabled them to open a trade with France,
who had, hitherto, been only a silent spectator, and
produced the sinews of a war which then unhappily
commenced.’</p>

<p>He then details the causes which led to his bankruptcy&mdash;how
the wars with the French, Spaniards,
and Dutch, all of whom had their men-of-war and
privateers, which preyed upon our commerce, ruined
the underwriters, and continues,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>‘In two years only of the war I lost, on a balance,
thirty-one thousand pounds, which obliged me, in
1781, to quit the Coal Trade, after carrying it on so
many years, when I had returned’ (? turned over)
‘above a Million of money, the profits of which have
been sunk as an Underwriter, that I might have the
use of my capital employed in it, to pay my unfortunate
losses.... Last year, I was obliged to make
a sacrifice of my desirable habitation at Battersea
Rise, where I had resided ten years, and expended a
considerable sum of money, the fruits of many years of
industry, before I became acquainted with Lloyd’s
Rooms.</p>

<p>‘These reserves, however, proved ineffectual, and
I found it necessary, on examining the state of my
accounts early in January last, to call my Creditors
together; for, though some months preceding I
found my fortune rapidly on the decline, I never
suspected my being insolvent till that view of my
affairs, when I found a balance in my favour of only
nine thousand pounds, from which was to be deducted
a fourth part owing me by brokers, who,
unfortunately for me as well as themselves, were
become bankrupts. This surplus, it was clear, would
not bear me through known, though unsettled, losses,
besides what might arise on unexpired risques. I
therefore, without attempting to borrow a shilling
from a friend, resorting to false Credit, or using any
subterfuge whatever, after depositing what money
remained in my hands, the property of others, laid
the state of my affairs before my Creditors.</p>

<p>‘This upright conduct made them my friends;
they immediately invested me with full power to
settle my own affairs, and have acted with liberality
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
and kindness. They were indebted for the early
knowledge I gave them of my affairs to the regularity
of my accounts; for, had I rested my inquiry
till after the broker’s yearly accounts were chequed,
in all probability a very trifling dividend would have
ensued. Had the merchant been obliged to stand his
own risque during the late war, few concerned on
the seas would have been able to withstand the
magnitude of their losses.</p>

<p>‘The only alleviation to comfort me in this affliction
has arose from the consideration that I have
acted honourably by all men; that, neither in prosperity
nor adversity, have I ever been influenced by
mean or mercenary motives in my connections with
the world, of which I can give the most satisfactory
proofs; that, when in my power, benevolence ever
attended my steps; the deserving and needy never
resorted to me in vain, nor has gratitude ever been
wanting to express any obligations or kindnesses
received from those I have had transactions with by
every return in my power. I have the further consolation
of declaring that, in winding up my affairs,
I have acted with the strictest impartiality in every
demand both for and against my estate; that I have
(unsolicited) attended every meeting at Guildhall to
protect it against plunder. A dividend was made as
soon as the bankrupt laws would permit, and the
surplus laid out in interest for the benefit of the
estate, till a fair time is allowed to know what demands
may come against it. I am fully convinced
that it will not be &pound;15,000 deficient; above double
that sum I have left in Lloyd’s Rooms as a profit
among the brokers.</p>

<p>‘No prospect opening of embarking again in business
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
for want of Capital to carry it on, I was advised
to make my case known to the administration, which
has been done both by public and private application
of my friends, who kindly interceded in my behalf
for some respectable post under Government, and
met with that kind reception from the Minister
which gave me every prospect of success, which I
flatter myself I have some natural claim to, from the
consideration that, as trade is the support of the
nation, it could not be carried on without Underwriters.</p>

<p>‘And as the want of protection to the trade of
the Country, from the host of enemies we had to
combat, occasioned by misfortunes, whom could I
fly to with more propriety than to Government? as,
by endeavouring to protect commerce, I fell a martyr
on the conclusion of an unfortunate war. I was
flattered with hopes that my pretensions to an appointment
were not visionary, and that I was not
wanting in ability to discharge the duties of any
place I might have the honour to fill. The change
of administration<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> which happened soon after was
death to my hopes, and, as I had little expectation of
making equal interest with the Minister who succeeded,
I have turned my thoughts to a matter which
appeared capable of being a most essential improvement
in the conduct of the Press;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> and, by great
attention and assiduity for a year past, it is now
reduced from a very voluminous state and great
incorrectness to a system which, I hope, will meet
the public approbation and countenance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>‘Such is the brief state of a Case which I trust
humanity will consider deserving a better fate.
Judge what must be my sensations on this trying
occasion: twenty-six years in the prime of life passed
away, all the fortune I had acquired by a studious
attention to business sunk by hasty strides, and the
world to begin afresh, with the daily introduction to
my view of a wife and six children unprovided for,
and dependent on me for support. Feeling hearts
may sympathise at the relation, none but parents
can conceive the anxiety of my mind in such a state
of uncertainty and suspense.’</p>

<p>From an unprejudiced perusal of this ‘case,’ the
reader can but come to the conclusion that Mr. John
Walter was not overburdened with that inconvenient
commodity&mdash;modesty; and that his logic&mdash;judged by
ordinary rules&mdash;is decidedly faulty. But that he did
try to help himself, is evidenced by the following
advertisement in the <i>Morning Post</i> of July 21, 1784:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

countenance on this occasion are the misfortunes in
which (in common with many other respectable
Citizens) I have been involved by the calamities of
the late war, and an unblemished reputation,
which has survived the wreck of my fortune. Having
been a Liveryman twenty-four years, during

greatly instrumental in establishing the very office

<p>How did he come to this (to us) familiar address?
It was by a chance which came in his way, and he
seized it. In 1782 he, somehow, became acquainted
with a compositor named Henry Johnson, who pointed
out the trouble and loss of time occasioned by setting
up words with types of a single letter, and proposed
that at all events those words mostly in use
should be cast in one. These were called ‘Logotypes’
(or word types), and printing, therefore, was
called ‘Logography.’ Caslon at first made the types&mdash;but
there is evidence that they quarrelled, for in a
letter of August 12, 1785, in the <i>Daily Universal
Register</i> of that date, which he reprinted in broadside
form, he says, ‘Mr. Caslon, the founder (whom I at
first employed to cast my types), calumniated my
plan, he censured what he did not understand, wantonly
disappointed me in the work he engaged to
execute, and would meanly have sacrificed me, to
establish the fallacious opinion he had promulgated.’</p>

<p>People had their little jokes about the ‘Logotypes,’
and Mr. Knight Hunt, in his ‘Fourth Estate,’ writes,
‘It was said that the orders to the type-founder ran
after this fashion, “Send me a hundred-weight of
heat, cold, wet, dry, murder, fire, dreadful robbery,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
atrocious outrage, fearful calamity, and alarming
explosion.”’ That he obtained not only literary, but
royal recognition of his pet type, is shown by a foot-note
to the letter above quoted (respecting Mr.
Caslon),</p>

<p>‘Any gentleman who chuses may inspect the
Logographic Founts and Types, at the Printing-office,
or at the British Museum, to which place they
have been removed from the Queen’s Palace.’</p>

<p>Where he got his money from he does not say, but
on the 17th of May, 1784, he advertised that ‘Mr.
Walter begs to inform the public that he has purchased
the printing-house formerly occupied by Mr.
Basket near Apothecaries Hall, which will be opened
on the first day of next month for printing words
entire, under his Majesty’s Patent;’ and he commenced
business June 1, 1784.</p>

<p>Printing House Square stands on the site of the
old Monastery of Blackfriars. After the dissolution
of the monasteries, in Henry the Eighth’s time, it
passed through several hands, until it became the
workshop of the royal printer. Here was printed,
in 1666, the <i>London Gazette</i>, the oldest surviving paper
in England; and, the same year, the all-devouring
Great Fire completely destroyed it. Phœnix-like, it
arose from its ashes, more beautiful than before&mdash;for
the writer of ‘A New View of London,’ published in
1708, thus describes it: <i>Printing House Lane</i>, on
the E side of Blackfryars: a passage to the <i>Queen’s
Printing House</i> (which is a stately building).’</p>

<p>‘Formerly occupied by Mr. Basket,’ a printer,
under the royal patent, of Bibles and Prayer-books.
To him succeeded other royal and privileged printers.
Eyre and Strahan, afterwards Eyre, Strahan, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
Spottiswoode, now Spottiswoode and Co., who, in
1770, left Printing House Square, and moved to New
Street, Fleet Street, a neighbourhood of which, now,
that firm have a virtual monopoly.</p>

<p>John Walter could not have dreamed of the palace
now built at Bearwood; for, like most mercantile
men of his day, he was quite content to ‘live over
the shop’; and there, in Printing House Square,
his son, and successor, John (who lived to build
Bearwood), was born, and there James Carden,
Esq., received his bride, John Walter’s eldest daughter,
who was the mother of the present venerable
alderman, Sir Robert Carden. There, too, died his
wife, the partner of his successes and his failures,
in the year 1798.</p>

<p>The first work printed at this logographic printing
establishment was a little story called, ‘Gabriel,
the Outcast.’ Many other slight works followed;
but these were not enough to satisfy the ambitions
of John Walter, who, six months after he commenced
business, started a newspaper, the <i>Daily Universal
Register</i>, on the 1st of January, 1785.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Even at that
date there was no lack of newspapers, although our
grandfathers were lucky to have escaped the infliction
of the plague of periodicals under which we
groan; for there were the <i>Morning Post</i>, the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, the <i>General Advertiser</i>, <i>London Gazette</i>,
<i>London Chronicle</i>, <i>Gazetteer</i>, <i>Morning Herald</i>, <i>St.
James’s Chronicle</i>, <i>London Recorder</i>, <i>General Evening
Post</i>, <i>Public Advertiser</i>, <i>Lounger</i>, <i>Parker’s General
Advertiser</i>, &amp;c. So we must conclude that John
Walter’s far-seeing intelligence foretold that a good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
daily paper, ably edited, would pay. It was logographically
printed, and was made the vehicle of
puffs of the proprietor’s hobby. The <i>Times</i> was also
so printed for a short period, but, eventually, it proved
so cumbersome in practice, as absolutely to hinder
the compositors, instead of aiding them.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1788, was born a baby that
has since grown into a mighty giant. On that day
was published the first number of <span class="smcap">the Times</span>, <i>or Daily
Universal Register</i>, for it had a dual surname, and
the reasons for the alteration are given in the following
‘editorial.’</p>

<h3>‘<span class="smcap">The Times.</span></h3>

<p>‘Why change the head?</p>

<p>‘This question will naturally come from the Public&mdash;and
<i>we</i>, the <i>Times</i>, being the <span class="smcap">Public’s</span> most humble
and obedient Servants, think ourselves bound to
answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘All things have <i>heads</i>&mdash;and all <i>heads</i> are liable to
<i>change</i>.</p>

<p>‘Every sentence and opinion advanced by Mr.
<i>Shandy</i> on the influence and utility of a well-chosen
surname may be properly applied in showing the
recommendations and advantages which result from
placing a striking title-page before a book, or an
inviting <span class="smcap">Head</span> on the front page of a <i>Newspaper</i>.</p>

<p>‘A <span class="smcap">Head</span> so placed, like those <i>heads</i> which once
ornamented <i>Temple Bar</i>, or those of the <i>great Attorney</i>,
or <i>great Contractor</i>, which, not long since, were
conspicuously elevated for their <i>great actions</i>, and
were exhibited, in wooden frames, at the <i>East</i> and
<i>West</i> Ends of this Metropolis, never fails of attracting
the eyes of passengers&mdash;though, indeed, we do
not expect to experience the lenity shown to these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
<i>great exhibitors</i>, for probably the <span class="smcap">Times</span> will be pelted
without mercy.</p>

<p>‘But then, a <i>head</i> with a <i>good face</i> is a harbinger,
a gentleman-usher, that often strongly recommends
even <span class="smcap">Dulness</span>, <span class="smcap">Folly</span>, <span class="smcap">Immorality</span>, or <span class="smcap">Vice</span>. The
immortal Locke gives evidence to the truth of this
observation. That great philosopher has declared
that, though repeatedly taken in, he never could
withstand the solicitations of a well-drawn title-page&mdash;authority
sufficient to justify <i>us</i> in assuming a <i>new
head</i> and a <i>new set of features</i>, but not with a design
to impose; for we flatter ourselves the <span class="smcap">Head</span> of the
<span class="smcap">Times</span> will not be found deficient in <i>intellect</i>, but,
by putting a <i>new face</i> on affairs, will be admired
for the <i>light of its countenance</i>, whenever it appears.</p>

<p>‘To advert to our first position.</p>

<p>‘The <span class="smcap">Universal Register</span> has been a name as injurious
to the <i>Logographic Newspaper</i>, as <span class="smcap">Tristram</span> was
to <span class="smcap">Mr. Shandy’s Son</span>. But <span class="smcap">Old Shandy</span> forgot he
might have rectified by <i>confirmation</i> the mistakes of
the <i>parson</i> at <i>baptism</i>&mdash;with the touch of a <i>Bishop</i>
have changed <span class="smcap">Tristram</span> to Trismegistus.</p>

<p>‘The <span class="smcap">Universal Register</span>, from the day of its first
appearance to the day of its <i>confirmation</i>, has, like
<span class="smcap">Tristram</span>, suffered from unusual casualties, both
laughable and serious, arising from its name, which,
on its introduction, was immediately curtailed of
its fair proportion by all who called for it&mdash;the word
<i>Universal</i> being <i>Universally</i> omitted, and the word
<i>Register</i> being only retained.</p>

<p>‘“Boy, bring me the <i>Register</i>.”</p>

<p>‘The waiter answers: “Sir, we have not a library,
but you may see it at the <i>New Exchange Coffee
House</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>‘“Then I’ll see it there,” answers the disappointed
politician; and he goes to the <i>New Exchange</i>, and
calls for the <i>Register</i>; upon which the waiter tells
him he cannot have it, as he is not a subscriber,
and presents him with the <i>Court and City Register</i>,
the <i>Old Annual Register</i>, or, if the Coffee-house be
within the Purlieus of Covent Garden, or the hundreds
of Drury, slips into the politician’s hand <i>Harris’s
Register</i> of Ladies.</p>

<p>‘For these and other reasons the parents of the
<span class="smcap">Universal Register</span> have added to its original name
that of the</p>

<h3>TIMES,</h3>

<p>Which, being a <i>monosyllable</i>, bids defiance to <i>corrupters</i>
and <i>mutilaters</i> of the language.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">The Times!</span> What a monstrous name! Granted,
for <span class="smcap">the Times</span> <i>is</i> a many-headed monster, that speaks
with an hundred tongues, and displays a thousand
characters, and, in the course of <i>its</i> transformations in
life, assumes innumerable shapes and humours.</p>

<p>‘The critical reader will observe we personify our
<i>new name</i>; but as we give it no distinction of sex,
and though <i>it</i> will be <i>active</i> in <i>its</i> vocations, yet we
apply to <i>it</i> the <i>neuter gender</i>.</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">The Times</span>, being formed of materials, and possessing
qualities of opposite and heterogeneous natures,
cannot be classed either in the animal or vegetable
<i>genus</i>; but, like the <i>Polypus</i>, is doubtful, and in the
discussion, description, dissection, and illustration
will employ the pens of the most celebrated among
the <i>Literati</i>.</p>

<p>‘The <span class="smcap">Heads of the Times</span>, as has been said, are
many; they will, however, not always appear at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
same time, but casually, as public or private affairs
may call them forth.</p>

<p>‘Each of which are supplied with a competent share
of intellects for the pursuit of their several functions;
an endowment which is not in <i>all times</i> to be found
even in the <span class="smcap">Heads</span> of the <i>State</i>, the <i>heads</i> of the

nor <i>tails</i>. On the <span class="smcap">Parliamentary Head</span> every communication
that ability and industry can produce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
may be expected. To this great <i>National object</i>, <span class="smcap">the
Times</span> will be most sedulously attentive, most accurately
correct, and strictly impartial in its <i>reports</i>.’</p>

<p>The early career of the <i>Times</i> was not all prosperity,
and Mr. Walter was soon taught a practical lesson
in keeping his pen within due bounds, for, on July
11th, 1788, he was tried for two libellous paragraphs
published in the <i>Times</i>, reflecting on the characters
of the Duke of York, Gloucester, and Cumberland,
stating them to be ‘insincere’ in their profession of
joy at his Majesty’s recovery. It might have been
an absolute fact, but it was impolitic to print it, and
so he found it, for a jury found him guilty.</p>

<p>He came up for judgment at the King’s Bench on
the 23rd of November next, when he was sentenced
by the Court to pay a fine of fifty pounds, to be imprisoned
twelve months in Newgate, to stand in the
pillory at Charing Cross, when his punishment should
have come to an end, and to find security for his
good behaviour.</p>

<p>He seems to have ridden a-tilt at all the royal
princes, for we next hear of him under date of 3rd of
February, 1790, being brought from Newgate to the
Court of King’s Bench to receive sentence for the
following libels:</p>

<p>For charging their Royal Highnesses the Prince of
Wales and Duke of York with having demeaned
themselves so as to incur the displeasure of his
Majesty. This, doubtless, was strictly true, but it
cost the luckless Walter one hundred pounds as a
fine, and another twelve months’ imprisonment in
Newgate.</p>

<p>This, however, was not all; he was arraigned on
another indictment for asserting that His Royal Highness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the Duke of Clarence returned from his station
without leave of the Admiralty, or of his commanding
officer, and for this he was found guilty, and sentenced
to pay another hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Whether he made due submission, or had powerful
friends to assist him, I know not,&mdash;but it is said that
it was at the request of the Prince of Wales&mdash;at all
events, he received the king’s pardon, and was released
from confinement on 7th of March, 1791, after
which time he never wrote about the king’s sons in a
way likely to bring him within the grip of the Law.</p>

<p>From time to time we get little <i>avisos</i> as to the
progress of the paper, for John Walter was not one
of those who hide their light under a bushel. Contrast
the printing power then with the magnificent ‘Walter’
machines of the present day, which, in their turn, will
assuredly be superseded by some greater improvement.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i>, 7th of February, 1794. ‘The Proprietors
have for some time past been engaged in making
alterations which they trust will be adequate to
remedy the inconvenience of the late delivery complained
of; and after Monday next the <span class="smcap">Times</span> will be
worked off with three Presses, and occasionally with
four, instead of <span class="smcap">TWO</span>, as is done in all other Printing-offices,
by which mode two hours will be saved in
printing the Paper, which, notwithstanding the lateness
of the delivery, is now upwards of <span class="smcap">Four Thousand
Three Hundred</span> in sale, daily.’</p>

<p>The following statement is curious, as showing us
some of the interior economy of the newspaper in its
early days. From the <i>Times</i>, April 19, 1794:</p>

<h3>‘<span class="smcap">To the Public.</span></h3>

<p>‘It is with very great regret that the Proprietors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
of this Paper, in Common with those of other Newspapers,
find themselves obliged to increase the daily
price of it <span class="smcap">One Halfpenny</span>, a measure which they
have been forced to adopt in consequence of the Tax
laid by the <i>Minister</i> on <i>Paper</i>, during the present
Session of Parliament, and which took place on the
5th instant.</p>

<p>‘While the Bill was still pending, we not only
stated in our Newspaper, but the Minister was himself
informed by a Committee of Proprietors, that the
new Duty would be so extremely oppressive as to
amount to a necessity of raising the price, which it
was not only their earnest Wish, but also their Interest,
to avoid. The Bill, however, passed, after a long
consideration and delay occasioned by the great
doubts that were entertained of its efficacy. We
wish a still longer time had been taken to consider
it; for we entertain the same opinion as formerly, that
the late Duty on Paper will not be productive to the
Revenue, while it is extremely injurious to a particular
class of Individuals, whose property was very
heavily taxed before.</p>

<p>‘In fact, it amounts either to a Prohibition of
printing a Newspaper at the present price, or obliges
the Proprietors to advance it. There is no option
left; the price of Paper is now so high that the Proprietors
have no longer an interest to render their
sale extensive, as far as regards the profits of a large
circulation. The more they sell at the present price,
the more they will lose; to us alone the <i>Advance</i> on
Paper will make a difference of &pound;1,200 sterling per
Annum more than it formerly cost us&mdash;a sum which
the Public must be convinced neither can, nor ought
to be afforded by any Property of the limited nature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
of a Newspaper, the profits on the sale of which are
precisely as follows:</p>

<h3>‘<span class="smcap">Sale.</span></h3>

<p class="hang">
2,000 Newspapers sold to the Newshawkers at 3½d., with a
further deduction of allowing them a Paper in every Quire
<span class="author"> ... ... ... &pound;26 18 6.</span></p>

<h3>‘<span class="smcap">Cost of 2,000 Papers.</span></h3>

<p class="hang">
A Bundle of Paper containing 2,000 Half-sheets, or 2,000 Newspapers
at Four Guineas per Bundle, which is the price it will
be sold at under the new Duty is &pound;4 4 0.</p>

<p>‘This is the whole Profit on the sale of two thousand
Newspapers, out of which is to be deducted the
charges of printing a Newspaper (which, on account
of the Rise in Printers’ Wages last year, is &pound;100 a year
more than it ever was before), the charges of Rent,
Taxes, Coals, Candles (which are very high in every
Printing-office), Clerks, general Superintendance, Editing,
Parliamentary and Law Reports, and, above all, the
Expenses of <span class="smcap">Foreign Correspondence</span>, which, under
the present difficulties of obtaining it, and the different
Channels which must be employed to secure a
regular and uninterrupted Communication, is immense.
If this Paper is in high estimation, surely the Proprietors
ought to receive the advantage of their
success, and not the Revenue, which already monopolises
such an immense income from this property, no
less than to the amount of &pound;14,000 sterling during last
year only. We trust that these reasons will have
sufficient weight with the Public to excuse us when
we announce, though with very great regret, that on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
Monday next the price of this Paper will be <i>Fourpence
Halfpenny</i>.’</p>

<p>Occasionally, the proprietor fell foul of his neighbours;
vide the <i>Times</i>, November 16, 1795:</p>

<p>‘All the abuse so lavishly bestowed on this Paper
by other Public Prints, seems as if designed to betray,
that in proportion as our sale is <i>good</i>, it is <i>bad</i> <span class="smcap">Times</span>
with them.’</p>

<p>In the early part of 1797, Pitt proposed, among
other methods of augmenting the revenue, an additional
stamp of three halfpence on every newspaper.
The <i>Times</i>, April 28, 1797, groaned over it thus:</p>

<p>‘The present daily sale of the <span class="smcap">Times</span> is known to
be between four and five thousand Newspapers. For
the sake of perspicuity, we will make our calculation
on four thousand only, and it will hold good in proportion
to every other Paper.</p>

<p>‘The Newsvendors are now allowed by the Proprietors
of every Newspaper two sheets in every
quire, viz., twenty-six for every twenty-four Papers
sold. The stamp duty on two Papers in every quire
in four thousand Papers daily at the old Duty of
2d., amounts to &pound;780 a year, besides the value of
the Paper. An additional Duty of 1½d. will occasion
a further loss of &pound;585 in this one instance
only, for which there is not, according to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Pitt’s</span> view of the subject, to be the smallest remuneration
to the Proprietors. Is it possible that
anything can be so unjust? If the Minister persists
in his proposed plan, it will be impossible for Newspapers
to be sold at a lower rate than sixpence
halfpenny per Paper.’</p>

<p>Pitt, of course, carried out his financial plan, and
the newspapers had to grin, and bear it as best they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
could&mdash;the weaker going to the wall, as may be seen
by the following notices which appeared in the <i>Times</i>,
July 5:</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">To the Public</span>.</p>

<p>‘We think it proper to remind our Readers and the
Public at large that, in consequence of the heavy
additional Duty of Three Half-pence imposed on every
Newspaper, by a late Act of Parliament, which begins
to have effect from and after this day, the Proprietors
are placed in the very unpleasant position of being
compelled to raise the price of their Newspapers to
the amount of the said Duty. To the Proprietors of
this Paper it will prove a very considerable diminution
of the fair profits of the Trade; they will not, however,
withdraw in the smallest degree any part of the
Expenses which they employ in rendering the <span class="smcap">Times</span>
an Intelligent and Entertaining source of Information:
and they trust with confidence that the Public will
bestow on it the same liberal and kind Patronage
which they have shown for many years past; and for
which the Proprietors have to offer sentiments of sincere
gratitude. From this day, the price of every
Newspaper will be Sixpence.’</p>

<p>July 19, 1797. ‘Some of the <span class="smcap">Country Newspapers</span>
have actually given up the Trade, rather than stand
the risk of the late enormous heavy Duty: many
others have advertised them for Sale: some of those
printed in Town must soon do the like, for the fair
profits of Trade have been so curtailed, that no Paper
can stand the loss without having a very large proportion
of Advertisements. We have very little
doubt but that, so far from Mr. Pitt’s calculation of a
profit of &pound;114,000 sterling by the New Tax on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Newspapers, the Duty, the same as on <span class="smcap">Wine</span>, will
fall very short of the original Revenue.’</p>

<p>July 13, 1797. ‘As a proof of the diminution in
the general sale of Newspapers since the last impolitic
Tax laid on them, we have to observe, as one
instance, that the number of Newspapers sent
through the General Post Office on Monday the 3rd
instant, was 24,700, and on Monday last, only 16,800,
a falling off of nearly <i>one-third</i>.’</p>

<p>Once again we find John Walter falling foul
of a contemporary&mdash;and indulging in editorial
amenities.</p>

<p>July 2, 1798. ‘The <i>Morning Herald</i> has, no doubt,
acted from <i>very prudent motives</i> in declining to state
any circumstances respecting its sale. All that we
hope and expect, in future, is&mdash;that it will not attempt
to injure this Paper by insinuating that it was
in a declining state; an assertion which it knows to
be false, and which will be taken notice of in a different
way if repeated. The <i>Morning Herald</i> is at
liberty to make any other comments it pleases.’</p>

<p>Have the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Standard</i> copied
from John Walter, when they give public notice that
their circulation is so-and-so, as is vouched for by a
respectable accountant? It would seem so, for this
notice appeared in the <i>Times</i>:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘We have subjoined an Affidavit sworn yesterday
before a Magistrate of the City, as to the present sale
of the <span class="smcap">Times</span>.</p>

<p>‘“We, C. Bentley and G. Burroughs, Pressmen of
the <i>Times</i>, do make Oath, and declare, That the number
printed of the <i>Times</i> Paper for the last two
months, has never been, on any one day, below 3
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
thousand, and has fluctuated from that number to
three thousand three hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>‘And, in order to avoid every subterfuge, I moreover
attest, That the above Papers of the <span class="smcap">Times</span>
were paid for to me, previous to their being taken by
the Newsmen from the Office, with the exception of
about a dozen Papers each morning which are spoiled
in Printing.</p>

</p>

<p>From this time the career of the <i>Times</i> seems to
have been prosperous, for we read, January 1, 1799,</p>

<h3>‘<span class="smcap">The New Year.</span></h3>

<p>‘The New Year finds the <span class="smcap">Times</span> in the same situation
which it has invariably enjoyed during a long
period of public approbation. It still continues to
maintain its character among the Morning Papers,
as the most considerable in point of sale, as of
general dependence with respect to information, and
as proceeding on the general principles of the British
Constitution. While we thus proudly declare our
possession of the public favour, we beg leave to express
our grateful sense of the unexampled patronage
we have derived from it.’</p>

<p>Mr. John Walter was never conspicuous for his
modesty, and its absence is fully shown in the preceding
and succeeding examples (January 1, 1800):</p>

<p>‘It is always with satisfaction that we avail ourselves
of the return of the present Season to acknowledge
our sense of the obligation we lay under to the
Public, for the very liberal Patronage with which
they have honoured the <span class="smcap">Times</span>, during many years; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
constancy of favour, which, we believe, has never
before distinguished any Newspaper, and for which
the Proprietors cannot sufficiently express their most
grateful thanks.</p>

<p>‘This Favour is too valuable and too honourable
to excite no envy in contemporary Prints, whose
frequent habit it is to express it by the grossest
calumnies and abuse. The Public, we believe, has
done them ample justice, and applauded the contempt
with which it is our practice to receive them.’</p>

<p>As this self-gratulatory notice brings us down to
the last year of the eighteenth century, I close this
notice of ‘The <i>Times</i> and its Founder.’ John
Walter died at Teddington, Middlesex, on the 26th of
January, 1812.

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Imprisonment</span> for debt has long ceased
to exist in England; debtors now only
suffering incarceration for contempt of
Court: that is to say, that the judge has
satisfied himself that the debtor has the
means to pay, and will not. But, in the eighteenth
century, it was a fearful fact, and many languished in
prison for life, for most trifling sums. Of course, there
were debtors <i>and</i> debtors. If a man had money or
friends, much might be done to mitigate his position;
he might even live outside the prison, in the Rules, as
they were called, a limited district surrounding the
prison; but for this advantage he must find substantial
bail&mdash;enough to cover his debt and fees. But
the friendless poor debtor had a very hard lot, subsisting
on charity, going, in turn, to beg of passers-by
for a coin, however small, rattling a box to call attention,
and dolorously repeating, ‘Remember the poor
prisoners.’</p>

<p>There were many debtors’ prisons, and one of the
principal, the Fleet, was over-crowded; in fact, they
all were full. Newgate, the Marshalsea, the Gate
House, Westminster, the Queen’s Bench, the Fleet,
Ludgate, Whitecross Street, Whitechapel, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
peculiar one belonging to St. Katharine’s (where are
now the docks).</p>

<p>Arrest for debt was very prompt; a writ was taken
out, and no poor debtor dare stir out without walking
‘beard on shoulder,’ dreading a bailiff in every passer-by.
The profession of bailiff was not an honoured
one, and, probably, the best men did not enter it; but
they had to be men of keen wit and ready resource,
for they had equally keen wits, sharpened by the
dread of capture, pitted against them. Some rose to
eminence in their profession, and as, occasionally,
there is a humorous side even to misery, I will tell a
few stories of their exploits. As I am not inventing
them, and am too honest to pass off another man’s
work as my own, I prefer telling the stories in the
quaint language in which I find them.</p>

<p>‘<i>Abram Wood</i> had a Writ against an <i>Engraver</i>, who
kept a House opposite to <i>Long Acre</i> in <i>Drury Lane</i>,
and having been several times to serve it, but could
never light on the Man, because he work’d at his
business above Stairs, as not daring to shew his Head
for fear of being arrested, for he owed a great deal of
Money, Mr. <i>Bum</i> was in a Resolution of spending
no more Time over him; till, shortly after, hearing
that one <i>Tom Sharp</i>, a House-breaker, was to be
hang’d at the end of <i>Long Acre</i>, for murdering a
Watchman, he and his Follower dress’d themselves
like Carpenters, having Leather Aprons on, and
Rules tuck’d in at the Apron Strings: then going
early the morning or two before the Malefactor was
to be executed, to the place appointed for Execution,
they there began to pull out their Rules, and were
very busie in marking out the Ground where they
thought best for erecting the Gibbet. This drew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
several of the Housekeepers about ’em presently, and
among the rest the <i>Engraver</i>, who, out of a selfish
humour of thinking he might make somewhat the
more by People standing in his House to see the
Execution, in Case this Gibbet was near it, gave
<i>Abram</i> a Crown, saying,</p>

<p>‘“<i>I’ll give you a Crown more if you’ll put the Gibbet
hereabouts</i>;” at the same time pointing where he
would have it.</p>

<p>‘Quoth <i>Abram</i>: “<i>We must put it fronting exactly
up</i> Long Acre; <i>besides, could I put it nearer your door,
I should require more Money than you propose, even as
much as this</i>” (at the same time pulling it out of his
pocket) “<i>Writ requires, which is twenty-five Pounds.</i>”
So, taking his prisoner away, who could not give in
Bail to the Action, he was carried to Jayl, without
seeing <i>Tom Sharp</i> executed.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘<i>William Browne</i> had an Action given him against
one <i>Mark Blowen</i>, a Butcher, who, being much in
debt, was never at his Stall, except on <i>Saturdays</i>, and
then not properly neither, for the opposite side of the
way to his Shop being in the Duchy Liberty<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> (with
the Bailiff whereof he kept in Fee) a Bailiff of the
Marshal’s Court could not arrest him. From hence he
could call to his Wife and Customers as there was
occasion; and there could <i>Browne</i> once a week see
his Prey, but durst not meddle with him. Many a
Saturday his Mouth watered at him; but one Saturday
above the rest, <i>Browne</i>, stooping for a Purse, as
if he found it, just by his Stall, and pulling five or six
guineas out of it, the Butcher’s Wife cry’d “Halves;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
his Follower, who was at some little distance behind
him, cry’d out, “Halves” too.</p>

<p>‘<i>Browne</i> refused Halves to either, whereupon they
both took hold of him, the Woman swearing it was
found by her Stall, therefore she would have half;
and the Follower saying, As he saw it as soon t’other,
he would have a Share of it too, or he would acquaint
the Lord of the Mannor with it. <i>Mark Blowen</i>, in the
meantime, seeing his Wife and another pulling and
haling the Man about, whom he did not suspect to
be a Bailiff, asked, “What’s the Matter?” His wife
telling him the Man had found a Purse with Gold in
it by her Stall, and therefore she thought it nothing
but Justice but she ought to have some of it.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Ay ay</i>,” (quoth the Butcher), “<i>and nothing but
Reason, Wife</i>.”</p>

<p>‘So, coming from his privileged side of the Way, he
takes hold of <i>Browne</i> too, bidding his Wife look after
the Shop, for he would take care of him before they
parted.</p>

<p>‘<i>Browne</i>, being thus hemm’d in by his Follower
and the Butcher, quoth he:</p>

<p>‘“<i>Look’ee here, Gentlemen, I have Six Guineas here,
’tis true, but, if I should give you one half of it, why,
then there is but a quarter Share of the other two.</i>”</p>

<p>‘“<i>No, no</i>”, (replyed they), “<i>we’ll have Man and Man
alike, which is Two Guineas apiece</i>.”</p>

<p>‘“<i>Well</i>,” (quoth Browne), “<i>if it must be so, I’m contented;
but, then, I’ll tell you what, I’ll have the odd
Eighteen Pence spent</i>.”</p>

<p>‘“<i>With all my heart</i>,” said Blowen. “<i>We’ll never
make a dry Bargain on’t.</i>”</p>

<p>‘They are all agreed, and <i>Browne</i> leads them up
to the <i>Blackmore’s Head</i> Alehouse, in <i>Exeter Street</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
where a couple of Fowls are ordered to be laid
down, and Stout and Ale is called for by wholesale.
At last they went to Dinner, and, afterwards,
<i>Browne</i>, changing his Six Guineas for Silver, gave
his Follower (to carry on the jest) Forty Shillings,
and put the rest in his pocket. <i>Mark Blowen</i>, seeing
that, began to look surly, and asked for his Share.</p>

<p>‘Said <i>Browne</i>: “<i>What Share, friend?</i>”</p>

<p>‘Quoth <i>Mark Blowen</i>: “<i>Forty Shillings, as you gave
this Man here.</i>”</p>

<p>‘<i>Browne</i> reply’d: “<i>Why, truly, Sir, I shall have an
urgent Occasion to Night for what Sum I have about me,
and if you’ll be pleas’d to lend me your Share but till</i>
Monday <i>Morning, I’ll come and pay you then at this
House without fail, and return you, with infinite thanks,
for the Favour.</i>”</p>

<p>‘Quoth <i>Mark</i> (who was a blundering, rustical sort
of a Fellow): “<i>D&mdash;&mdash; me, Sir, don’t think to Tongue-Pad
me out of my Due. I’ll have my Share now, or
else he that’s the best Man here of us three shall have it
all, win it, and wear it.</i>”</p>

<p>‘“<i>Pray, Sir</i>,” (said <i>Browne</i>), “<i>don’t be in this Passion.
I’ll leave you a sufficient Pledge for it till</i> Monday.”</p>

<p>‘Quoth <i>Mark</i>: “<i>Let’s see it.</i>”</p>

<p>‘Hereupon <i>Browne</i> pulls out his Tip-Staff, and lays
it on the Table; but the Butcher, not liking the
Complexion of it, began to be moving, when the
Follower, laying Hands on him, they arrested him in
an Action of Eighteen Pounds, and carried him to the
<i>Marshalsea</i>, where, after a Confinement of Nine Months,
he ended his Days.’</p>

<p>There is another famous bailiff on record, named
Jacob Broad; and of him it is narrated that, ‘being
employed to arrest a Justice of the Peace living near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
<i>Uxbridge</i>, he went down there very often, and had
us’d several Stratagems to take him, but, his Worship
being very cautious in conversing with any of <i>Jacob’s</i>
Fraternity, his Contrivances to nap him prov’d always
abortive. However, a great deal of Money was proffer’d
by the Creditor to take the worshipful Debtor;
so one Day <i>Jacob</i>, with a couple of his Followers,
took a Journey in the Country, and, being near the
end of their Journey, <i>Jacob</i> alights, and flings his
Bridle, Saddle, and Boots into a Thick Hedge, and
then puts a Fetlock<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> on his Horse. The Followers
tramp’d it a-foot, to one of whom giving the Horse,
he leads it to a Smith at <i>Uxbridge</i>, and, telling him
he had lost the Key of the Fetlock, he desir’d him
to unlock it, whilst he went to a neighbouring Alehouse,
where he would give him a Pot or two of
Drink for his Pains. Accordingly the Smith unlockt
it, and carried the Horse to the Alehouse; and, after
he had drank Part of half-a-dozen of Drink, return’d
to his Work again. Shortly after, came the other
Follower to the Smith, inquiring if he did not see
such a Horse come by that way, describing at the
same time the Colour and Marks of it, and how his
Master had lost him out of his Grounds that Morning.
The Smith reply’d, that such a Horse was brought
to him but a little before, to have a Fetlock taken
off, and that he did imagine the Fellow to be a
Rogue that had him; but, however, he believ’d he
was still at such an Alehouse hard by, and might
be there apprehended. Hereupon the Smith and
Follower went to the Alehouse, where they found
the Horse standing at the Door, and the other Follower
in the House, whom they call’d a thousand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
Rogues, and charg’d with a Constable for a Thief.
In the meantime, came <i>Jacob Broad</i>, who own’d the
Horse to be his, and the Town-People, being all in
a hurly-burly, they carried him before the Justice
whom <i>Jacob</i> wanted; but no sooner were <i>Jacob</i>, the
supposed Thief, and the other Follower entered the
House, but charging the Constable to keep the Peace,
they arrested his Worship, and brought him forthwith
to <i>London</i>, where he was forc’d to pay the
Debt of two hundred and thirty-four Pounds before
he could reach home again.’</p>

<p>Another story is related of Jacob Broad.</p>

<p>‘A certain Gentleman who liv’d at <i>Hackney</i>, and
had been a Collector of the late Queen’s Duties, but
cheated her of several thousands of Pounds, goes
home, and pretends himself sick. Upon this he
keeps his Bed, and, after a Fortnight’s pretended
Illness, it was given out that he was Dead. Great
preparations were then made for his Funeral. His
Coffin, which was filled with Bricks and Saw-Dust,
was covered with black Velvet, and his Wife, and
Six Sons and Daughters, all in deep Mourning, follow’d
it to the Grave, which was made in St. <i>John’s</i>
Church, at <i>Hackney</i>. This sham Funeral was so well
carried on, that all the People of the Town would
have sworn the Collector was really Dead. About
a Week after his supposed Interment, <i>Jacob Broad</i>
had an Action of one hundred and fifty Pounds
against him. He went to <i>Hackney</i> to serve the
Writ, but, enquiring after the Person he was to arrest,
and being told that he was dead and buried, he
return’d home again.</p>

<p>‘About Seven Years afterwards, the Creditor being
certainly inform’d that the Collector was alive and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
well in his own House, he employed <i>Jacob</i> again
to arrest him, and accordingly he and another went
to execute the Writ. <i>Jacob</i> planted himself in an
Alehouse adjacent to the long-supposed Deceased’s
Habitation, and, while his Aid-de-Camp, or Follower,
was doing something else, he told a Woman, coming
by with a great Load of Turnips on her Head, that
the People of such a House wanted some, which was
the House where the Seven Years dead Man dwelt.
She went forthwith and knockt at the Door, which
was open’d to let her in, and the Follower, who was
close at her Heels, rush’d in after her, and ran into a
Back Parlour, where he saw the Person (according to
the Description of him) whom he wanted sitting by
the Fire Side. It happening then to be a festival
Day, for the Entertainment of the Collector’s Children,
and Grand Children, the Table was spread with
Variety of Dainties; the Follower leapt over the
Table, overthrowing the Viands on it, and laying
hold of the Prisoner, all their Mirth was spoilt at
once. In the mean Time came <i>Jacob Broad</i>, and,
taking out the supposed dead Man, he seem’d to be
overjoy’d at his Resurrection from a Seven Years’
Confinement and for tasting the fresh Air. <i>Jacob</i>
brings him to <i>London</i>, whence he remov’d himself by
a Writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i> to the King’s Bench Prison
in <i>Southwark</i>, where he died again in a Week’s time,
for he was never heard of till he was seen about
Three Years after in <i>Denmark</i>.</p>

<p>‘<i>Jacob Broad</i> was always very happy in having
Followers as acute as himself in any sort of Roguery,
especially one <i>Andrew Vaughan</i>, afterwards a Bailiff
himself on Saffron Hill, and one <i>Volly Vance</i>, otherwise
call’d <i>Glym Jack</i> from his having been a Moon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Curser,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> or Link Boy ... From a Link Boy <i>Glym
Jack</i> came to be <i>Jacob Broad’s</i> Follower, who,
together with <i>Andrew Vaughan</i>, he once took into
the Country along with him to arrest a Justice of
Peace, who was one of the shyest cocks that ever
<i>Jacob</i> had to take by Stratagem. In order to accomplish
this Undertaking, <i>Jacob</i>, <i>Andrew</i>, and <i>Glym
Jack</i> were very well drest in Apparel, and mounted
on good Geldings, having fine Hangers on their
Sides, and Pistols in their Holsters, beside Pocket
Pops sticking in their Bosoms. Being thus accoutred
they rid into an Inn in the Town where the Justice
of Peace they wanted dwelt, and, putting up their
Horses, they ask’d the Landlord for a private Room,
which, being accommodated with, they refresh’d
themselves with a good Dinner, and afterwards set
to play.</p>

<p>‘Whilst they were shaking their Elbows at 7 or
11 nick it, a great deal of Money and three or four
Watches lying on the Table, when at last one of ’em
cry’d, this Watch is my Snack, for I’m sure I first
attackt the Gentleman from whom we took it; another
swore such a Purse of Gold was his, which
they had taken that Morning from a Gentlewoman,
and, in short, everyone of ’em was swearing such a
Prize was his, all which the Landlord (who listened
at the Door) overhearing, thought to himself they
were all Highwaymen. Hereupon he goes and
acquaints the shy Justice of Peace with the matter,
who ask’d <i>If he were sure they were Rogues</i>.</p>

<p>‘“<i>Nothing,</i>” (quoth the Innkeeper), “<i>is more certain,
for they are all arm’d with more Pistols than ordinary,</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
<i>swearing, damning, cursing, and sinking every Word they
speak, and falling out about dividing their Booty.”</i></p>

<p>‘“<i>Ay, ay</i>,” (reply’d the Justice), “<i>they are then certainly
Highwaymen</i>,” and so order’d him to secure
them.</p>

<p>‘The Innholder went for a Constable, who, with a
great many Rusticks, arm’d with Pitch Forks, long
Poles, and other Country Weapons, went with the
Landlord to the Inn, suddenly rush’d into the Room,
and surpriz’d <i>Jacob</i> and his Followers, with Money
and Watches lying before them.</p>

<p>‘“<i>So</i>,” (says the Constable), “<i>pretty Gentlemen, are
not ye, that honest people can’t travel the Country without
being robb’d by such villains as you are?&mdash;Well</i>,” (quoth
the Constable to <i>Jacob</i>), “<i>what’s your Name?</i>”</p>

<p>‘His answer was <i>Sice-Ace</i>.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>‘“<i>A fine Rogue, indeed!</i>” said the Constable, at the
same time asking <i>Andrew</i> his Name, whose answer
was,</p>

<p>‘“<i>Cinque-Duce</i>.”</p>

<p>‘“<i>Another Rogue in Grain!</i>” quoth the Constable;
and then ask’d <i>Glym Jack</i> what his Name was, who
reply’d,</p>

<p>‘“<i>Quater-Tray</i>.”</p>

<p>‘“<i>Rogues! Rogues all!</i>” said the Constable; “<i>ay,
worse than all, they are mear Infidels, Heathens, for I
never heard such names before in a Christian Country.
Come, Neighbours, bring ’em away before Mr. Justice,
his Worship will soon make them change their Notes.</i>”</p>

<p>‘Accordingly the Rusticks haled them along the
Town to his Worship’s House, into which they were
no sooner enter’d but he began to revile <i>Jacob</i> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
his Brethren for Highwaymen, and asking them their
Names, they still were in the same Tone of <i>Sice-Ace</i>,
<i>Cinque-Duce</i>, and <i>Quater-Tray</i>, at which the Justice,
lifting up his Hands and Eyes to the Ceiling, cry’d
out, <i>Such audacious Rogues as these were never seen
before</i>.</p>

<p>‘“<i>Here, Tom,</i>” (quoth his Worship to his Clerk),
“<i>write their</i> Mittimus, <i>for I will send them everyone to</i>
Newgate.”</p>

<p>‘Whilst their Commitment was writing, <i>Jacob</i> pulls
a Bit of Parchment out of his Pocket, and, asking the
Constable if he could read it, he put on his Spectacles,
and posing and mumbling over it a Minute or two,
said,</p>

<p>‘“<i>I cannot tell what to make of it. It is Latin, I
think.</i>”</p>

<p>‘“<i>Well, then,</i>” (quoth Jacob), “<i>I’ll tell you what it
is, it is the King’s Process against this Gentleman that is
going to commit us to</i> Newgate; <i>therefore, in my Execution
of it, I require you, as you are a Constable, to keep
the Peace.</i>”</p>

<p>‘This turn of the Dice made the Magistrate, the
Peace Officer, and all the Rusticks stare at one another
as if they were out of their Senses. However,
<i>Jacob</i> brought his Prisoner to <i>London</i>, and oblig’d
him to make Satisfaction before he got out of his
Clutches.’</p>

<p>The above anecdotes illustrate the humorous side
of a bailiff’s life, but sometimes they met with very
rough treatment, nay, were even killed. On the 4th
of August, 1722, a bailiff named Boyce was killed
by a blacksmith, who ran a red-hot iron into him;
and the book I have quoted from thus speaks of
bailiffs as ‘such Villains, whose Clan is suppos’d to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
descend from the cursed Seed of <i>Ham</i>, and therefore
stinks in the Nostrils of all honest Men. Some
of them have been paid in their own Coyn, for
Captain <i>Bew</i> kill’d a Sergeant of one of the Compters.
Shortly after, a Bailiff was kill’d in <i>Grays-Inn</i>
Walks; another Bailiff had his Hand chopt off
by a Butcher in <i>Hungerford</i> Market, in the <i>Strand</i>,
of which Wound he dyed the next Day, and another
Man kill’d two Bailiffs at once with a couple of
Pistols in <i>Houghton Street</i>, by <i>Clare Market</i>, for
which he was touch’d with a cold iron<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> at the
Sessions House at the <i>Old Baily</i>, besides several
others of that detestable Tribe have deservedly
suffer’d the same fate....</p>

<p>‘But, by the way, we must take Notice that a
Bailiff is Universally hated by Man, Woman, or Child,
who dearly love to see them duckt (Pick-pocket like)
in the <i>Muse</i> Pond,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> or the cleanly Pond of the Horse
Guards, at <i>Whitehall</i>, and sometimes well rinsed at
the <i>Temple</i>, or <i>Grays-Inn</i> Pump; and if any of these
napping Scoundrels is taken within the Liberty of
the <i>Mint</i>, the enraged Inhabitants of this Place tye
him fast with Ropes in a Wheelbarrow; then they
trundle him about the Streets, with great Shouts and
Huzzas.... After he is convey’d in the like
Order to a stinking Ditch, near <i>St. George’s</i> Fields,
where he is plunged over Head and Ears, <i>&agrave; la mode
de Pickpocket</i>; and then, to finish the Procession,
he is solemnly convey’d to a Pump, according to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
antient Custom of the Place, where he is sufficiently
drench’d for all his dirty Doings.’</p>

<p>This, as I have said, shows the humorous side of
imprisonment for debt. An unimpeachable and veracious
authority, one who only gave dry statistics,
and did not draw upon his imagination for his facts,
was John Howard, the philanthropist, who published,
in 1777, ‘The State of the Prisons in England and
Wales.’ From his report we learn that the allowance
to debtors was a penny loaf a day&mdash;and when we consider
that, during the French war, bread at one time
rose to a price equivalent to our half-crown per
quartern loaf, it could hardly be called a sufficient
diet. But the City of London, generous then, as
ever, supplemented this with a daily (? weekly)
supply of sixteen stone, or one hundred and twenty-eight
pounds, of beef, which, as Howard gives the
average of debtors in two years (1775-6) at thirty-eight,
would be more than ample for their needs&mdash;and
there were other charities amounting to fifty or
sixty pounds a year&mdash;but, before they were discharged,
they were compelled to pay the keeper a
fee of eight shillings and tenpence.</p>

<p>In the Fleet Prison they had no allowance, but, if
they made an affidavit that they were not worth five
pounds, and could not subsist without charity, they
had divided amongst them the proceeds of the begging-box
and grate, and the donations which were
sent to the prison. Of these, Howard says, at the
time of his visit, there were seventeen. But the
other prisoners who had any money had every facility
afforded them to spend it. There was a tap, at which
they could purchase whatever liquor they required;
there was a billiard-table, and, in the yard, they could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
play at skittles, Mississippi, fives, tennis, &amp;c. On Monday
nights there was a wine club, and on Thursday
nights a beer club, both of which usually lasted until
one or two in the morning; and pretty scenes of
riot and drunkenness took place. The prisoners were
allowed to have their wives and children to live with
them.</p>

<p>Ludgate had ceased to exist, and the debtors were
transferred to New Ludgate, in Bishopsgate Street.
It was a comparatively aristocratic debtors’ prison,
for it was only for debtors who were free of the City,
for clergymen, proctors, and attorneys. Here, again,
the generosity of the City stepped in; and, for an
average number of prisoners of twenty-five, ten stone,
or eighty pounds of beef, were given weekly, together
with a daily penny loaf for each prisoner. The lord
mayor and sheriffs sent them coals, and Messrs. Calvert,
the brewers, sent weekly two barrels of small
beer, besides which, there were some bequests.</p>

<p>The Poultry Compter was in the hands of a keeper
who had bought the place for life, and was so crowded
that some of the prisoners had to sleep on shelves
over the others, and neither straw nor bedding was
allowed them. The City gave a penny loaf daily to
the prisoners, and remitted for their benefit the rent
of thirty pounds annually; the Calverts also sent them
beer. At Howard’s visits, eight men had their wives
and children with them.</p>

<p>Wood Street Compter was not a pleasant abode,
for Howard says the place swarmed with bugs.
There were thirty-nine debtors, and their allowance
was a daily penny loaf from the City, two barrels of
beer weekly from the Calverts; the sheriffs gave them
thirty-two pounds of beef on Saturdays, and for some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
years a benevolent baker sent them, weekly, a large
leg and shin of beef.</p>

<p>At Whitechapel was a prison for debtors, in the
liberty and manor of Stepney and Hackney, but it
was only for very small debtors, those owing above
two pounds, and under five. Howard’s story of this
prison is a very sad one, the occupants being so very
poor:</p>

<p>‘The Master’s-side Prisoners have four sizeable
chambers fronting the road&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, two on each storey.
They pay two shillings and sixpence a week, and lie
two in a bed; two beds in a room. The Common-side
Debtors are in two long rooms in the Court
Yard, near the Tap-room. Men in one room, women
in the other: the Court Yard in common. They hang
out a begging-box from a little closet in the front
of the House, and attend it in turn. It brings them
only a few pence a day, and of this pittance none
partake but those who, at entrance, have paid the
keeper two shillings and sixpence, and treated the
Prisoners with half a gallon of beer. The last time
I was there, no more than three had purchased this
privilege....</p>

<p>‘At my first visit there were, on the Common-side,
two Prisoners in Hammocks, sick and very poor.
No chaplain. A compassionate Man, who is not a
regular Clergyman, sometimes preaches to them on
Sunday, and gives them some small relief. Lady
Townsend sends a Guinea twice a year, which her
Servant distributes equally among the Prisoners.</p>

<p>‘As Debtors here are generally very poor, I was
surprised to see, once, ten or twelve noisy men at
skittles; but the Turnkey said they were only visitants.
I found they were admitted here as at another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
public-house. No Prisoners were at play with
them.’</p>

<p>At St. Catherine’s, without the Tower, was another
small debtors’ prison. This parish was a ‘<i>peculiar</i>,’
the Bishop of London having no jurisdiction over it,
and the place was under the especial patronage of
the Queens of England ever since the time of Matilda,
the wife of Stephen, who founded a hospital there,
now removed to Regent’s Park. It was a wonderful
little parish, for there people could take sanctuary&mdash;and
there also were tried civil and ecclesiastical
cases. Howard says that the prison for debtors had
been rebuilt seven years before he wrote. It was a
small house of two storeys; two rooms on a floor.
In April, 1774, there was a keeper, but no prisoners.
‘I have since called two or three times, and always
found the House uninhabited.’</p>

<p>No notice of debtors’ prisons would be complete
without mention of the King’s Bench, which was in
Southwark. Howard reports:</p>

<p>‘The Prisoners are numerous. At more than one
of my visits, some had the Small Pox. It was so
crowded this last summer, that a Prisoner paid five
shillings a week for half a bed, and many lay in the
chapel. In May, 1766, the number of Prisoners
within the Walls was three hundred and ninety-five,
and, by an accurate list which I procured, their wives
(including a few only called so) were two hundred
and seventy-nine, children seven hundred and twenty-five&mdash;total,
one thousand and four; about two-thirds
of these were in the Prison.’</p>

<p>The prisoners had, as in the Fleet, their weekly
wine and beer clubs, and they also indulged in
similar outdoor sports. The Marshalsea and Horsemonger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
Lane gaol complete the list of London
debtors’ prisons.</p>

<p>Howard’s description of the county prisons is something
appalling. Gaol-fever, distemper, or small-pox
being recorded against most of them. At Chelmsford
there had been no divine service for above a
year past, except to condemned criminals. At
Warwick the debtors’ common day-room was the
hall, which was also used as a chapel. At Derby a
person went about the country, at Christmas-time, to
gentlemen’s houses, and begged for the benefit of
the debtors. The donations were entered in a book,
and signed by each donor. About fourteen pounds
were generally collected in this manner.</p>

<p>Chesterfield gaol was the property of the Duke of
Portland, and Howard describes it thus:</p>

<p>‘Only one room, with a cellar under it, to which
the Prisoners occasionally descend through a hole in
the floor. The cellar had not been cleaned for many
months. The Prison door had not been opened for
several weeks, when I was there first. There were
four Prisoners, who told me they were almost starved;
one of them said, with tears in his eyes, “he had not
eaten a morsel that day,”&mdash;it was afternoon. They
had borrowed a book of Dr. Manton’s; one of them
was reading it to the rest. Each of them had a
wife, and they had, in the whole, thirteen children,
cast on their respective parishes. Two had their
groats from the Creditors, and out of that pittance
they relieved the other two. No allowance: no
straw: no firing: water a halfpenny for about three
gallons, put in (as other things are) at the window.
Gaoler lives distant.’</p>

<p>At Salisbury gaol, just outside the prison gate, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
round staple was fixed in the wall, through which
was passed a chain, at each end of which was a
debtor padlocked by the leg, who offered for sale to
the passers-by, nets, laces, purses, etc., made in the
prison. At Knaresborough the debtors’ prison is
thus described:</p>

<p>‘Of difficult access; the door about four feet from
the ground. Only one room, about fourteen feet by
twelve. Earth floor: no fireplace: very offensive: a
common sewer from the town running through it
uncovered. I was informed that an Officer confined
here some years since, for only a few days, took in
with him a dog to defend him from vermin; but the
dog was soon destroyed, and the Prisoner’s face much
disfigured by them.’</p>

<p>The gaolers were not always the most gentle of
men, as may be seen by the trial of one Acton,
deputy-keeper and turnkey of the Marshalsea, for
the murder of a prisoner named Thomas Bliss. The
indictment will briefly tell the story:</p>

<p>‘That the said <i>William Acton</i>, being Deputy
Keeper, under <i>John Darby</i>, of the said prison, being
a person of inhuman and cruel disposition, did, on the
21st of October, in the Year of our Lord, 1726,
cruelly, barbarously, and feloniously Beat, Assault,
and Wound the said <i>Thomas Bliss</i> in the said Prison,
<i>viz.</i>, in the Parish of Saint George’s-in-the-Fields,
in the Borough of <i>Southwark</i>, in the County of
<i>Surrey</i>, and did put Irons and Fetters of great and
immense weight upon his legs, and an Iron Instrument,
and Engine of Torture, upon the Head of the
said <i>Thomas Bliss</i>, called the Scull-cap, and also
Thumb-screws upon his Thumbs; and the said
<i>Thomas Bliss</i> was so wounded, fettered, tortured and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
tormented in the Strong Room of the said Prison
(which is a dangerous, damp, noisome, filthy, and unwholesome
place) did put, and him did there detain
several days; by means of which excruciating Tortures,
close Confinement, Duress, and cruel Abuses,
the said <i>Thomas Bliss</i> got so ill an Habit of Body,
that he continued in a languishing Condition till the
25th Day of <i>March</i> following, and then died.’</p>

<p>Although the facts of the indictment were fully
borne out by the evidence, the jury acquitted Acton.
I should mention that Bliss had twice attempted to
escape from the prison.</p>

<p>Let us pass to a pleasanter theme, and see what
was the inner life of a debtor’s prison about 1750, the
story of which is told in a little book undated.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The

<h2 id="JONAS_HANWAY">JONAS HANWAY.</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> Jonas Hanway had lived before Fuller,
he certainly would have been enshrined
among his ‘Worthies;’ and it is astonishing
to find how comparatively ignorant
of him and his works are even well-read
men. Ask one about him, and he will reply that he
was a philanthropist, but he will hardly be able to
say in what way he was philanthropic: ask another,
and the reply will be that he was the man who introduced
umbrellas into England&mdash;but it is very questionable
if he could tell whence he got the umbrella
to introduce. But in his time he was a man of mark,
and his memory deserves more than a short notice in
‘Chalmers,’ the ‘Biographie Universelle,’ or any other
biographical dictionary.</p>

<p>He was born at Portsmouth on the 12th of August,
1712, in the reign of ‘good Queen Anne.’ History is
silent as to his pedigree, save and except that his
father was connected with the navy, and was for
some years store-keeper to the dockyard at Portsmouth,
and his uncle by the father’s side was a Major
John Hanway, who translated some odes of Horace,
&amp;c. His father died whilst Jonas was still a boy, and
Mrs. Hanway had much trouble to bring up her
young family, who all turned out well, and were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
prosperous in after life: one son, Thomas, filling the
post of commander-in-chief of his Majesty’s ships at
Plymouth, and afterwards commissioner of the dockyard
at Chatham.</p>

<p>On his father’s death, his mother removed to London,
where, somehow or other, she brought up her
children by her own exertions, and with such care
and affection that Jonas never spoke, or wrote, of his
mother but in terms of the highest reverence and
gratitude. He was sent to school, where he was
not only educated commercially, but classically.
Still, he had his bread to win, and, when he was
seventeen years of age, he was sent to Lisbon, which
he reached June, 1729, and was bound apprentice to a
merchant, under whose auspices he developed the
business qualities which afterwards stood him in
good stead. At the end of his apprenticeship he set
up in business for himself in Lisbon, but soon removed
to the wider field of London. What pursuit
he followed there, neither he, nor any biographer of
his, has told us, but in 1743 he accepted the offer of a
partnership in Mr. Dingley’s house at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>What a difference in the voyage from London to
St. Petersburg, then and now! Now, overland: it
only takes two days and a half.</p>

<p>Then, in April, 1743, he embarked on the Thames
in a crazy old tub, bound for Riga, and got to Elsinore
in May. As everything then was done in a
leisurely manner, they stopped there for some days,
arriving at Riga by the end of May, having taken
twenty-six days to go from Elsinore to Riga, now
done by steam, under fair conditions, in two days.</p>

<p>Here he found, as most people do, the Russian
spring as hot as he ever remembered summer in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Portugal, and was most hospitably entertained by
the British factors. But Russia was at war with
Sweden, and, although he had plenty of letters of
recommendation, the Governor of Riga would not
allow him to proceed on his journey, until he had
communicated with the authorities at St. Petersburg,
thus causing a delay of a fortnight, and he did not
leave until the 7th of June. His sojourn at Riga,
however, was not lost, for he kept his eyes open, and
looked about him.</p>

<p>Travelling by post in Russia, even now, is not a
luxury; it must have been ten times worse then,
when he started on his journey in his sleeping-wagon,
which was ‘made of leather, resembling a cradle, and
hung upon braces,’ and his report of his journey was
that ‘the post-horses are exceedingly bad, but as
the stages are short, and the houses clean, the inconvenience
is supportable.’ He made the journey in
four days.</p>

<p>On his arrival, he soon set to work on the business
that he came out to execute, namely, the opening of
trade through the Caspian Sea to Persia, a journey
which involved crossing Russia in Europe from the
north-west to the south-east. This route had already
been trodden by a sailor named Elton, who had
spent some years among the nomadic Tartar tribes,
and had, in 1739, descended the Volga with a cargo
of goods, intending to go to Mesched; but he sold
them before he reached there, at Resched, for a good
price, and obtained leave to trade for the future. He
returned to St. Petersburg, went again to Persia, and
remained there in the service of Nadir Shah. It was
to supply his defection that Jonas Hanway went out
to Russia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>On the 10th of September, 1743, he set out on his
veritably perilous journey, and it is really worth
while to describe the despatch of goods in Russia at
that day. ‘In Russia carriages for merchandize are
drawn only by one horse. These vehicles are nine
or ten feet long, and two or three broad, and are
principally composed of two strong poles, supported
by four wheels, of near an equal size, and about as
high as the fore wheels of our ordinary coaches, but
made very slight, many of the rounds of the wheels
are of a single piece of wood, and open, in one part,
for near an inch, and some of them are not shod with
iron.</p>

<p>‘The first care is to lay the bales as high as the
cart will admit on a bed of mats of the thickest sort.
Besides the original package, which is calculated to
stand the weather, the bales are usually covered
with very thick mats, and over these other mats are
laid to prevent the friction of the ropes; lastly, there
is another covering of mats, in the want of raw cowhides,
which are always best to defend goods from
rain, or from the snow, which, when it melts, is yet
more penetrating. Each bale is sealed up with a
leaden seal, to prevent its being opened on the road,
or any of the goods vended in the Country, that is,
when they are intended for Persia....</p>

<p>‘The Caravans generally set out about twelve, both
in the night and day, except in the heat of summer.
In the winter, between St. Petersburg and Moscow,
they usually travel seventy wersts<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> (about forty-seven
English miles) in twenty-four hours, but from Moscow
to Zaritzen only forty or fifty wersts: in summer their
stages are shorter. Great part of the last-mentioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
road being through an uninhabited country, makes
the Carriers cautious not to jade their horses. Every
time they set out, the conductors ought to count the
loads. When necessity requires that the Caravan
should be drawn within fences, or into yards, the
heads of the waggons ought to stand towards the
door in regular order, and a guard, who will keep a
better watch than an ordinary carrier, should be set
over it: for want of this precaution, whole Caravans
in Russia have been sometimes consumed by fire.
It is most eligible to stop in the field, where the usual
method is to form the Carriages into a ring, and bring
the horses, as well as the men, within it, always observing
to keep in such a position as best to prevent
an attack, or repulse an enemy.</p>

<p>‘The Khalmucks on the banks of the Volga are
ever ready to embrace an opportunity of plundering
and destroying passengers; therefore, when there is
any occasion to travel on those banks, which should
be avoided as much as possible, an advance guard of
at least four Cossacks is of great use, especially to
patrole in the night; it is not often practised, but I
found it indispensably necessary when I travelled on
those banks....</p>

<p>‘A hundred carriages take up two-thirds of a mile
in length, so that, when no horseman is at hand to
spread the alarm, the rear might be easily carried off.
They have not even a trumpet, horn, or other instrument
for this purpose; they trust in providence, and
think any care of this kind unnecessary, though the
neglect has sometimes proved of fatal consequence.’</p>

<p>In this primitive style he set forth on his trading
venture to Persia, taking with him a clerk, a Russian,
as menial servant, a Tartar boy, and a soldier, by way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
of guard. He had ‘a convenient sleeping-waggon’
for himself, and another for his clerk&mdash;the Russ, the
Tartar, and the soldier evidently having to shift as
the drivers of the twenty loads of goods (consisting
of thirty-seven bales of English cloth) did. It is interesting
to follow out this little venture. The
caravan started on the 1st of September, 1743, and
ten days afterwards he set out to join it, which he
did at Tver, arriving at Moscow on the 20th of
September.</p>

<p>Here he looked about him, saw the Great Bell, &amp;c.
received no little hospitality, and repaired the defects
of his caravan, starting again on the 24th of
September, and his instructions to his limited suite
were to avoid all occasion of dispute, and, should such
unfortunately arise, he should be informed of it, in
order that he might deal with it according to the
best of his judgment. But he went among the Tartars
without any misadventure, noting some very
curious facts, until he came to Tzaritzin, on the
Volga, whence he proposed to commence his somewhat
perilous journey by water, to the Caspian Sea.
He arrived at Tzaritzin on the 9th of October, but,
as there was not the same pushing and driving in
business then as now, he stopped there for a month
to recruit, and hire a vessel. He succeeded in getting
one, such a thing as it was, but then he only
paid a nominal sum for it. As he justly observes:
‘The reader will imagine that forty roubles<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> cannot
purchase a good vessel; however, this price produced
the best I could find. Their decks were only
loose pieces of the barks of trees; they have no
knees, and but few beams: hardly any pitch or tar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
is used, in place of it are long slips of bark, which
they nail over the gaping seams, to prevent the
loose and bad corking (caulking) from falling out.
Instead of iron bolts, they have spikes of deal with
round heads. The method of keeping them clear of
water is by a large scoop, which is suspended by the
beam over the well-way, and through a scuttle at a
proper height they scoop out the water with great
facility.’</p>

<p>He bought two of these A.1. vessels, and put a crew
of five fishermen on board each, besides his own suite,
and, because of the pirates who infested those waters,
he hired a guard of six soldiers. By-the-way, they had
a rough and ready way of dealing with these pirates
when they did catch them. ‘As their cruelties are
very great, so is the punishment inflicted on them
when they are taken. A float is built, in size according
to the number of delinquents, and a gallows
erected on it, to contain a sufficient number of iron
hooks, on which they are hung alive, by the ribs.
The float is launched into the stream, with labels
over their heads, signifying their crimes; and orders
are given to all towns and villages on the borders of
the river, upon pain of death, not only to afford no
relief to any of these wretches, but to push off the
float, should it land near them. Sometimes their
partners in wickedness meet them, and, if there are
any signs of life, take him down, otherwise they shoot
them dead; but, if they are catched in these acts of
illegal mercy, they are hung up without the ceremony
of a trial, as happened about eight years ago.
They tell me of one of these miscreants who had the
fortune to disengage himself from the hook, and
though naked, and trembling with pain and loss of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
blood, he got ashore. The first object he saw who
could afford him any relief was a poor shepherd,
whose brains he beat out with a stone, and took his
clothes. These malefactors sometimes hang thus
three, four, and five days alive. The pain generally
produces a raging fever, in which they utter the most
horrid imprecations, and implore the relief of water,
or other small liquors.’</p>

<p>He was observant, and, on his journey down the
Volga, he noted many things which throw much
light on the social life in Russia of these days. Take
for instance the following: ‘The 14th of October
I sent letters to my friends, by messengers who are
appointed to attend a box of grapes, which is sent
from Astrachan to the Empress’s Court every three
days during the season. It is carried by two horses,
supported in the manner of a litter. The grapes are
preserved in sand, but, at best, are ill worth the
expense of the conveyance for one thousand two
hundred English miles.’</p>

<p>He sailed from Tzaritzin on the 14th of October,
and on the 19th of the same month he reached
Astrachan, where he was kindly received by Mr.
George Thompson, agent to the British merchants
trading to Persia; and also by the Russian governor
(a quondam page to Peter the Great) who gave him
many assurances that every help should be afforded
him in his trade with Persia&mdash;but candidly informed
him what rogues the Armenian traders were: ‘They
are the most crafty people in all Asia, and delight in
fraud. Let them get fifty per Cent. in a fair way, they
are not contented without cheating five, and the five
is sweeter than the fifty.’</p>

<p>Lapow, even then, was a recognized institution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
in Russia, for Hanway observes, ‘The Officers of the
the Admiralty and Custom-House of Astrachan have
very small salaries, which is the case in all other
places in Russia: so that, instead of doing their
duty to despatch business, they often seek pretences
to protract it, in order to obtain the more considerable
presents. Upon these occasions French Brandy,
white wine, hats, stockings, ribbons, and such like
are acceptable.’ Now-a-days, things are managed in
a less cumbrous form. Rouble Notes take the place of
gross material&mdash;but the Russian Official is unchanged.</p>

<p>Again, ‘Whilst I was busied in getting what informations
were necessary, the governor invited me
to a feast, at which there were nearly a hundred
dishes; here I saw a singular specimen of Russian
intemperance, for there were above thirty people who
drank to excess, in goblets, a kind of cherry brandy.
This feast was made for the birth of his granddaughter,
on which occasion the guests presented an
offering each according to his rank. This is a civil
way of levying a heavy tax on the merchants, and a
custom, tho’ not elegant, less absurd than that of
some politer countries; for here, without disguise or
ceremony, you leave one or two ducats, or some
richer present on the lady’s bed, who sits up with
great formality to be saluted.’</p>

<p>From Astrachan he went to Yerkie, at the mouth
of the Volga, and virtually on the Caspian Sea,
whence he set sail on the 22nd of November, arriving
at Astrabad Bay on the 18th of December, where
his vessel was taken for a pirate, and signal fires
were, in consequence, lit on the hill-tops, etc. So he
lay at anchor for a few days, employing his men in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
packing his goods so that they might be easily carried
on land; and he gives us a curious insight into
the life of sailors of that period.</p>

<p>‘The 25th being Christmas Day, I excused the
seamen from the package of cloth, and prevailed on
them to hear prayers, and a sermon. English seamen,
of all mankind, seem the most indifferent with
regard to religious duties; but their indifference is
more the effect of want of reflection than the
irreligious carelessness of their leaders. It is not to
be imagined they would fight less if they prayed
more; at least we find the praying warriors in
Cromwell’s days fought as if they were sure of becoming
saints in heaven. Certain it is our seamen
do not entertain the same impressions of religion as
the common run of labouring people.’</p>

<p>Hanway had been warned that he must take care
of himself at Astrabad; that, probably, he would be
robbed, and most certainly cheated; but never having
received such treatment, and with his conscious
faith of being an honest Englishman, he gave but
little heed to the caution, but spent many days on
ship-board, making up his merchandize into suitable
packages for land carriage, and when he did land, he
went in state, on horseback, to visit the governor,
taking with him the invariable Oriental present,
which, in his case, consisted of fine cloth, and loaves
of sugar. He was kindly received by the governor,
but soon having experienced the deceit and duplicity
of the people, he hurried forward his departure for
Mesched, sending ten camel loads of goods in advance.
Luckily he did so, for the next day the town
was besieged by Turcomans, who wanted to get possession
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
of the Shah’s treasure, then in Astrabad, as
well as the English goods, which presented an almost
irresistible temptation to them.</p>

<p>Hanway was advised to disguise himself and fly,
but he was an Englishman, and had the pluck of his
race; so he concluded to stay, in spite of the objurgations
and maledictions of some of the inhabitants,
who cursed him as being the cause of their
misfortunes. The town made but a feeble resistance,
and, soon after its fall, Hanway received a visit
from the captors, the story of which he thus tells:</p>

<p>‘I had collected my servants in one room, from
whence I sent a little boy, a servant, who understood
the Turkish language, which is most known to the
Khajars, to conduct these hostile visitors to us, and to
tell them that, as we were at their mercy, we hoped
they would treat us with humanity. They immediately
entered, and assured us they did not mean to hurt us;
on the contrary, that as soon as their government was
established, they would pay me for my goods. They
demanded, at the same time, where they were lodged;
and informed me that the forty bales which I had
sent out of the town some days before, were already
in their possession. Mahommed Khan Beg then demanded
my purse, which I had prepared with about
thirty crowns in gold and silver; he contented himself
for the present with counting it, and then returned
it to me, demanding if I had any more, for
that it would be the worse for me if I concealed any.
I thought it warrantable, however, to make an evasive
answer, though it was a true one as to the fact; <i>viz.</i>,
that all the town knew very well that I had been
searching for money in exchange for my bill on Mr.
Elton, not having sufficient to convey my Caravan to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
Mesched. As gold can purchase anything except
virtue and health, understanding and beauty, I
thought it might now administer to our safety. I
therefore reserved a purse of one hundred and sixty
crowns in gold, apprehending that the skilful application
of it might ward off the danger which threatened
us; but I afterwards found that our security
was in our supposed poverty, for in near three weeks
distress, I durst not show a single piece of gold,
much less acknowledge that I had saved any money.’</p>

<p>He made up his mind to leave Astrabad as soon as
possible, and, having obtained an acknowledgment
of the value of his goods, at last set out with an
escort of about two dozen armed men, under the
command of a Hadji, or a holy man, who had made
a pilgrimage to Mecca. Needless to say his escort
were a pack of rogues, and it was by sheer good
luck, and at some risk, that, at last, he fell in with
some officers of the Shah, who were recruiting for
forces wherewith to re-conquer Astrabad. They
helped him to horses, although he complained of their
quality. He got along somehow, although he lost
his servants, and at last he reached Langarood,
where the renegade Captain Elton lived, seven
weeks after he had left Astrabad, and was received
by Elton with open arms. Here he stayed some days
to recruit, and then pushed on to Reshd.</p>

<p>A few days more of journeying, and he fell in with
the Shah’s camp, but failed to have an interview
with that exalted potentate. Still his case was
brought before Nadir Shah, and, the bill Hanway
had received from Mohammed Hassan being produced
as evidence, a decree was issued ‘that I should
give the particulars of the loss to Behbud Khan, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Shah’s general at Astrabad, who had orders to deliver
to me whatever part of the goods might possibly be
found, and to restore them in kind, and the deficiency
to be paid out of the sequestered estates of the rebels
to the last denier. This was not quite the thing
which I wished for, because it laid me under a
necessity of returning to that wretched place, Astrabad;
however, I could not but acknowledge the
highest obligation for so signal a mark of justice and
clemency.’</p>

<p>This act of justice was somewhat unusual with
Nadir Shah, of whose cruelty Hanway gives several
examples. As, however, one perhaps outstrips its
companions in brutality, I venture to give it in his
words. ‘I will give another example of Nadir’s
avarice and barbarity, which happened a little before
I was in camp. The Shah, having appointed a certain
general as governor of a province, imposed an
exorbitant tax on it, to be levied in six months: at
the expiration of the time the governor was sent for
to the camp, and ordered to produce the account. He
did so, but it amounted to only half the sum demanded.
The Shah called him a rascal; and, telling him
he had stolen the other half of the money, ordered
the executioner to bastonade him to death: his
estates also being confiscated, all his effects fell very
short of the demands. The servants of the deceased
were then ordered to come into the Shah’s presence,
and he inquired of them if there was anything left
belonging to their master; to which they answered,
<i>Only a dog</i>. He then commanded the dog to be
brought before him; and observed that he appeared
to be much honester than his master had been; however,
that he should be led through the camp from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
tent to tent, and beaten with sticks, and wherever he
expired, the master of such tent should pay the sum
deficient. Accordingly the dog was carried to the
tents of the ministers, successively, who, hearing the
case, immediately gave sums of money, according to
their abilities, to procure the removal of the dog: by
which the whole sum the Shah demanded was raised
in a few hours’ time.’</p>

<p>On the 27th of March they set out on their return
journey, accompanied by a small escort; they were
detained for some time at Langarood, where Hanway
had hoped to find a vessel, as the way by land was
insecure. But, although a ship was sighted, she
never put in; and the land journey was therefore,
perforce, undertaken, and Astrabad was reached on
the 16th of May. He saw the Shah’s general, who
said ‘the decree must be obeyed.’ Those who had
insulted Hanway were most brutally punished&mdash;some
of his cloth was recovered and given back to him,
but there was a difficulty in raising the money for
the missing portions, and he was pressed to take
payment in women slaves. On his refusal, they begged
of him to give them a receipt as if he had been
paid, assuring him the money should be forthcoming
in a very few days; but the British merchant was too
wary to be caught in such a palpable trap. Eventually
he got the greater part of it, and with it returned
to Langarood, where he waited for some little
while, and, at last, he recovered eighty-five per cent.
of the value of his goods, according to his own valuation,
so that, probably, he made a good sale.</p>

<p>At Langarood he fell ill of a low fever, but was
cured by a French missionary, who administered
Jesuit’s bark (quinine) to him, and he then set out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
on his return journey, having invested all his cash in
raw silk. He met with no particular adventures, and
arrived safely at St. Petersburg on the 1st of January,
1745, ‘having been absent a year and sixteen weeks,
in which time I had travelled about four thousand
English miles by land.’</p>

<p>In noticing this trip of Hanway’s to the Caspian,
it would be a pity if attention were not called to his
description of Baku, now coming so much to the
front (thanks to the industry and intelligence of the
Messrs. Nobel) in providing the world with petroleum.
This was the chief shrine of the followers of Zoroaster,
who considered light, which was typified by fire,
(which is bright both by day and night) as emblematical
of all good, and they therefore worshipped
Ormuzd, or the good god, whilst they regarded
Ahriman, or darkness, as the evil god. Here, near
Baku, the soil is so soaked and saturated with
petroleum that a fire, natural and never-ceasing, could
easily be obtained, and consequently, being perfectly
unartificial, was looked upon as the personification of
Ormuzd. Hanway writes, ‘The earth round this
place, for above two miles, has this surprizing property,
that by taking up two or three inches of the
surface and applying a live coal, the part which is
so uncovered immediately takes fire, almost before
the coal touches the earth.... If a cane, or tube
even of paper, be set about two inches in the ground,
confined and closed with earth below, and the top of
it touched with a live coal, and blown upon, immediately
a flame issues without hurting either the cane
or the paper, provided the edges be covered with
clay, and this method they use for light in their
houses, which have only the earth for the floor; three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
or four of these lighted canes will boil water in a
pot; and thus they dress their victuals.’</p>

<p>Baku, the seat of this natural symbol of Ormuzd,
was then a place of pilgrimage for the Parsees&mdash;and
it is not so long since that fire-worship there has been
discontinued. Mr. Charles Marvin (writing in 1884)
commences his most interesting book, ‘The Region of
the Eternal Fire,’ thus: ‘A few years ago a solitary
figure might have been daily seen on the shore of the
Caspian Sea, worshipping a fire springing naturally
from the petroleum gases in the ground. The devotee
was a Parsee from India, the last of a series of
priests who for more than two thousand five hundred
years had tended the sacred flame upon the spot.
Round about his crumbling temple was rising greasy
derricks, and dingy distilleries&mdash;symbols of a fresh
cult, the worship of mammon&mdash;but, absorbed in his
devotions, the Parsee took no heed of the intruders.
And so time passed on, and the last of the Fire-Worshippers
died, and with him perished the flame
that was older than history.’</p>

<p>He stayed some time in Russia, but undertook no
more arduous journeys. Even when he did leave St.
Petersburg, on the 9th of July, 1750, he travelled
very leisurely overland, reaching Harwich on the 28th
of October, 1750, after an absence from England of
nearly eight years. He lived in London in a modest
fashion, for his fortune was but modest&mdash;yet it was
sufficient for him to keep a <i>solo</i> carriage, <i>i.e.</i>, only
carrying one person, and on its panels was painted a
device allusive to his dangers in Persia, especially of
a somewhat perilous voyage on the Caspian. It consisted
of ‘a man dressed in the Persian habit, just
landed in a storm on a rude coast, and leaning on his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
sword, his countenance calm and resigned. In the
background was depicted a boat tossed about by the
billows; in front, a shield charged with his arms
leaning against a tree, and underneath the motto, in
English, <i>Never Despair</i>.’</p>

<p>As a result of his eastern experiences,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> on his return
to England he used an umbrella, which at that time
for a man to carry was considered somewhat effeminate.
He is often credited with having introduced
that useful article into England; but it had been
generally used by women for fifty years previously&mdash;nay,
there is in the British Museum (Harl. 630
fol. 15b,) an Anglo-Saxon MS. of the eleventh century&mdash;unmistakeably
English in its drawing&mdash;wherein
is an illustration of an umbrella being held (by an
attendant) over the head of a king, or nobleman.
It is a veritable ‘Sangster,’ and, as far as form goes,
it would pass muster now. From this time the use
of the umbrella became familiar, and in general use
among men&mdash;probably because he introduced them
of pure silk, whereas hitherto they had been cumbrous
and heavy, being made of oiled paper, muslin,
or silk.</p>

<p>He had enough to live on, and, as in those days no
one cared about making a colossal fortune, he lived
contentedly on his competence, and wrote a long
description of his travels, which was very well illustrated,
and which cost him &pound;700 to produce his first
edition of one thousand two hundred copies, after
which he disposed of the copyright, and second,
third, and fourth editions were published. Still, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
climate of Russia had not agreed with him, and he
had to go to the then fashionable Spa, Tunbridge
Wells, and afterwards to Paris, thence to Brussels,
Antwerp, and Amsterdam.</p>

<p>He returned to Tunbridge Wells, where he wrote
(in 1753) a treatise against the Naturalisation of the
Jews,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> which was a question then being agitated.
One can scarcely imagine a man with large sympathies,
as was Jonas Hanway, a travelled man, also,
of great experience of men, taking the narrow view
of such a question of social polity. After a severe
fight the Bill was carried (26 Geo. 2) and his Majesty
gave his consent on the 7th of June, 1753,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> but the
opposition to it was so great that when Parliament
next met (15th of November, 1753) the very first
business after the address (which only occupied half-an-hour
or so&mdash;a valuable hint to present M.P.’s) was
to bring in a bill repealing the privilege of Naturalization
to the Jews. Popular clamour on its behalf
was senseless, as it usually is, but it was too strong
to resist, and in the debate thereon, on the 27th of
November, 1753, William Pitt (all honour to him)
said, ‘Thus, sir, though we repeal this law, out of
complaisance to the people, yet we ought to let them
know that we do not altogether approve of what
they ask.’<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> The Bill was carried on the 28th of
November, and received the Royal Assent on the 20th
of December, the same year, and consequently an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
injustice was for some time done to some of the
loyalest, quietest, and most law-abiding citizens we
have. Hanway, however, thought so strongly on
the subject that he wrote four tractates upon it, which,
as the question is now happily settled, may be dismissed
with this brief notice.</p>

<p>He was naturally of a busy turn of mind, and
could not sit still. He wrote about anything&mdash;it did
not much matter what&mdash;of the paving, etc. of Westminster
and its adjacent parishes; he even wrote a
big book, beautifully illustrated, on a little trip he
took, when travelling was not so common as now,
‘A Journal of Eight days’ Journey from Portsmouth
to Kingston-on-Thames,’ (1756) a second edition of
which was published in two volumes in 1757, with the
addition of ‘An Essay on Tea, considered as pernicious
to Health, obstructing Industry, and impoverishing
the Nation.’ So we see he took strong
views on things in general, which have since, by experience,
been modified.</p>

<p>His scribbling propensities probably did some good,
for in 1757 we find him taking up the cause of that
very meritorious charity, the Marine Society, to
which he was a subscriber to the extent of fifteen
guineas. This society, whose house is in Bishopsgate
Street, is still alive, and, what is more, flourishing.
About this he wrote four or five pamphlets and
books. This seems only to have served as a whet to
his appetite for philanthropy, for in 1758 he paid &pound;50
to qualify himself as a Life-Governor of the Foundling
Hospital. This, naturally, led him to think upon
the source whence the foundlings principally came:
and he turned his attention towards the foundation
of a Magdalen (?) Hospital, which was, with the cooperation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
of several gentlemen, established in London
in 1758, in Great Prescott Street, Goodman’s
Fields (the site of which is now, or used to be, called
Magdalen Row).</p>

<p>Many more books and pamphlets on the above
subjects, the Foundling Hospital, the Marine and
Stepney Societies, the Encouragement of British
Troops, etc., occupied his leisure until 1760, when he
took in hand the social question of giving fees, or
<i>vails</i>, to servants, and wrote two pamphlets on the
subject. In one of them are some very humorous
stories of this absurd custom, one, especially, which
from its raciness has become somewhat hackneyed.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
‘It is a more <i>humorous</i> Story they tell of &mdash;&mdash; after
he had dined with &mdash;&mdash;. The Servants with assiduous
duty had taken the best care of his friend’s <i>Hat</i>,
<i>Sword</i>, <i>Cane</i>, <i>Cloak</i>, and among the rest his <i>Gloves</i> also.
When he came to demand them, every Servant, with
the most submissive respect, brought his part of the
Old Gentleman’s <i>personal furniture</i>, and so many
<i>Shillings</i> were distributed with his usual liberality;
but, as he was going away without his <i>Gloves</i>, one of
the Servants reminded him of it, to which he answered,
“<i>No matter, friend, you may keep the Gloves,
they are not worth a Shilling.</i>”’</p>

<p>Hanway tried to do away with this social tax,
which, however, remains to this day. But a very
good story is told of Robert Hamilton of Kilbrachmont.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>
‘After a party at Kellie Castle the guests
were passing through the Hall where the servants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
were drawn up to receive their vails, in those days a
customary exaction at great houses. The gifts of
those who preceded “Robbie” (as the Laird was
commonly called) drew forth no expression of gratitude,
not even a smile, but when his turn came for
performing the ceremony their features were at once
lighted up with something even approaching to a
laugh.</p>

<p>‘“What did you give the fellows, Robbie?” said
his friends, when they got outside; “they looked as
sour as vinegar till your turn came.”</p>

<p>‘“Deil a bawbee they got frae me,” said Robbie,
“I just kittled their loof.”’<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>This system of feeing servants received a crushing
blow on the production (in 1759) of the Rev. James
Townley’s farce of ‘High Life below Stairs,’ which
probably led to Hanway’s writing his two pamphlets
on the subject.</p>

<p>He used occasionally to go to Court&mdash;but never
solicited any place for himself; still it was thought
that his philanthropic exertions should be rewarded,
more especially as he had by no means a large fortune.
So a deputation of five prominent citizens of
London, amongst whom was Hoare the banker, waited
on Lord Bute (who was then Prime Minister), and
asked that some substantial recognition of his services
should made. Their representations had weight,
and, in July, 1762, he was appointed one of the commissioners
for victualling the Navy.</p>

<p>He was now in easy circumstances, and his official
duties could not have been very heavy, for in that
year he wrote four pamphlets on ‘Meditations on Life,
&amp;c.,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span> ‘Registration of the Parish Poor, and Ventilation,’

his pet Magdalens, and a ‘Disquisition on Peace
and War’ themes so diverse that they show the
variety of subjects that occupied his serious attention.
In fact, he scribbled on an infinity of things&mdash;all
having for their aim the benefit of mankind. He
had a financial scheme ‘for saving from Seventy
Thousand Pounds to One Hundred and Fifty Thousand
Pounds to the Public;’ he wrote on the ‘Uses and
Advantages of Music;’ the ‘Case of the Canadians at
Montreal;’ ‘The Soldier’s Faithful Friend, being
Moral and Religious Advice to private Men in the
Army and Militia;’ the ‘Registration of the Children
of the Poor;’ another pamphlet on the rising generation
of the labouring poor; and, not content with
addressing the private soldier, he must needs write
‘The Christian Officer, addressed to the Officers of
his Majesty’s forces, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>About this time he was evidently most <i>goody-goody</i>.
He wrote ‘Moral and Religious Instruction to young
Persons;’ ‘Moral and Religious Instructions, intended
for Apprentices among the lower Classes of the
People;’ ‘Letters to the Guardians of the Infant
Poor;’ ‘Rules and Regulations of the Magdalene
Hospital, with Prayers, &amp;c.;’ ‘Advice to a Daughter,
on her going to Service, &amp;c.;’ ‘Advice from a Farmer
to his Daughter;’ ‘Observations on the Causes of the
Dissoluteness which reigns among the lower Classes
of the People.’</p>

<p>He could not even leave to Mrs. Elizabeth Montague
of the ‘Blue-Stocking Club’ notoriety, her
championship and patronage of the poor little climbing
boys&mdash;and he fired off a pamphlet on ‘The State
of Chimney-Sweepers’ young Apprentices, &amp;c.’ These
poor little friendless mortals excited his pity, and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
first efforts in their behalf were to get them regularly
bound apprentices, so as to bring them under the
cognizance of the magistracy; he advocated and
inaugurated a subscription to defray the expense, and
supply them with clothes. And this movement was
attended with considerable success, for many boys
were bound apprentices, and some of the masters
were prosecuted for cruelty to their boys.</p>

<p>Then, to show the diversity of his talents, he
wrote two pamphlets on bread, and a book in two
volumes on ‘Virtue in humble life, &amp;c.’ In 1775 he
published a large quarto volume on ‘The Defects of
Police, the Causes of Immorality, &amp;c.,’ and in the
copy which I have before me, is written, ‘<span class="smcap">To the
King</span>, <i>with the Author’s most humble Duty</i>.’ In this
book, among other things, he advocated solitary, or
rather isolated confinement&mdash;permitting the prisoners
to work, and giving them an increased dietary according
to their labour, This was followed in 1776
by a pamphlet on ‘Solitude in Imprisonment, with
proper labour, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>He was now sixty-four years of age, but he was
as bodily active as he was mentally, and in
February, 1776, he had to go over to Hamburg in
connection with his duties as one of the commissioners
of the Victualling Board. In 1777, 1778, and
1782, he wrote three books on the Lord’s Supper&mdash;and
from that time he wrote, until he died in 1786, on
all sorts of subjects, religious, social, and political, a
list of which would only be wearisome. In the
summer of 1786 his health gave way, and he was
evidently sinking, but he lingered until the 5th of
September, when he calmly passed away&mdash;perfectly
prepared for the great change, putting on a fine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
ruffled shirt, giving up his keys, disposing of some
trinkets, and having his will read to him. Death
came easily to him, and he expired with the word
‘Christ’ upon his lips.</p>

<p>Such was the life, and such was the death, of
Jonas Hanway, whose biography is not half well
enough known.

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> little story, which I very much condense,
is most amusing, and is the work
of ‘Henry Blaine, Minister of the Gospel
at Tring, Herts.’ I only give it as
showing the dread with which any
country-bred man, at that time, put his precious body
at the mercy of Father Neptune. Steam has changed
all our habits, but then there were no ‘Globe Trotters,’&mdash;few,
if any, climbed the Alps for amusement;
the Dolomites were unknown; people had no steam-yachts
and went in pursuit of perpetual summer; a
cruise to the Pacific Islands and Japan was never
dreamt of; there was no Mudie’s library to scatter
broadcast holiday tours, for they never existed&mdash;so
that we must look upon this relation of an inland-bred
‘Minister of the Gospel’ (whose long and extremely
pious, but wearisome, exordia I omit) with
very different eyes, to a similar one published in the
present day.</p>

<p>It is a tract of fifty-four pages, and commences,
‘In hopes of recovering that invaluable blessing,
health, on Friday, August 10, 1787, I embarked
on board the ship <span class="smcap">Friends</span> bound for <span class="smcap">Ramsgate</span>, in
<span class="smcap">Kent</span>. I had heard there was such a place; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
many had raised my expectations by their reports of
the efficacy of sea-bathing; and others encouraged
my hopes by repeating their own experience of benefit
received. By these means I was induced to determine
on this little voyage. It reminded me of the never-to-be-forgotten
season, when, urged by some motives,
and impelled by a power unseen, but not unfelt, I
entered on board that stately vessel which the Lord’s
prophet saw in a storm. <i>Isaiah 54.&mdash;11.</i>’</p>

<p>This is a sample of the tract. He then goes on to
say: ‘While we waited for the time of sailing
(for different purposes, I suppose), many came on
board, and appeared, to me at least, as if they
intended to embark with us: but they left not the
harbour, but, urged by other occasions and inducements,
they took leave of their friends and departed;
while we, who were bound for a distant place, kept
steady to our purpose, turned our backs upon home
and waited patiently for the gentle breeze and driving
tide to convey us to the desired port.’</p>

<p>We can well imagine the good man, when he got
back to Tring, giving, for a long time, his soul-harrowing
experiences of that memorable voyage. He
should have lived in our days and have been ‘Our
Special Correspondent’ on whom the editor of the
newspaper relies to fill so many columns&mdash;for every
detail is taken, evidently note-book in hand. Witness
this: ‘When our sails were displayed, and our cable
unloosed, assisted by a gentle gale, we began by
degrees to view the lofty towers, the aspiring
churches, and all the grandeurs of London at a distance
behind us: in hopes of finding something we
could not find in town, we turned our attention from
the pleasures, and riches, and pomps of London; we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
bid farewel, for a time, to our dearest friends; we
laid aside our daily and domestic cares, and cheerfully
forsook the dear delights of home.’</p>

<p>At length they were fairly started on their voyage,
which from the crowded state of the river, and the
excessive timidity of the writer, must have been
vastly perilous. ‘Our vessel, though it set sail with
a fair wind, and gently fell down the river towards
her destined port, yet once or twice was nearly striking
against other vessels in the river, to her own
injury; but, by the care of the steersman and sailors,
she was timely prevented.... There was no
spectacle more affecting, in all the little voyage, than
the bodies of those unhappy malefactors which were
hung up, <i>in terrorem</i>, on the margin of the river
Thames. Surely these was some of the execrable
characters whom Justice pursued, who, though “they
escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffered not to live.
<i>Acts 28.&mdash;4.</i>” ... Having passed these spectacles
of horror, a fair wind and flowing tide smoothly carried
us towards the boundless ocean....</p>

<p>‘When we drew towards the conflux of the river
Thames there were two objects that attracted our
notice: the one, the King’s guardship, placed there
for the purposes of good œconomy, the other a large
painted vessel which floated on the surface of the
water, and is called a buoy. While we were passing
the king’s ship, I heard the report of a cannon,
and saw the flash of the charge at some distance;
and, on inquiring the reason of such a circumstance,
was informed it was customary for every ship which
passed, by way of obedience, to lower her topsail;
but the firing of the gun made them hasten to show
their obedience, for fear of a more unfavourable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
salute; for, though a flash of powder might give us
some alarm, the discharge of a ball might make us
<i>feel</i> the effects of disobedience.... Hitherto the
generality of our company appeared to carry jollity
and mirth in their countenances; but now we began
to see the blushing rose die in the sickly cheek,
and several of our passengers began to feel the sickening
effects of the rolling sea; they withdrew from
their mirth, and in pleasure crept into a corner, and
silently mourned their lost pleasures in solitude....
Thrice happy the souls who are by divine grace
made sick of unsatisfying delights, and compelled to
withdraw from unsatisfying objects, and seek and find
permanent bliss in the friendship of Immanuel!</p>

<p>‘There had been the appearance of affability and
good-humour kept up among the passengers of our
vessel, and a reciprocal exchange of civilities had
passed between them; our bad tempers were for
awhile laid aside, and we seemed mutually agreed to
make each other as innocently happy as our present.
If the same mode of conduct was observed through
the whole of our department, how would the ills of
life be softened, and the ties of society sweetened!...</p>

<p>‘The eyelid of the day was now nearly closed
upon us, and the gloom of darkness began to surround
us, which, together with the hollow bellowing
of the wind, and dashing waves, had a tendency to
create very solemn ideas in the mind; and I, being a
stranger to such scenes, had my mind exercised upon
things of greater importance....</p>

<p>‘About ten o’clock on Friday night we were
brought safely into the harbour of Margate, and then
cast anchor in order to set a great number of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
passengers on shore, who were bound for that place
of rendezvous. How great are the advantages of
navigation! By the skill and care of three men and
a boy, a number of persons were in safety conveyed
from one part to another of the kingdom....</p>

<p>‘When we had safely landed our passengers at
Margate, we weighed anchor at eleven o’clock at
night, in order to sail round the North Foreland for
Ramsgate. The North Foreland is a point of land
which stretches out some way into the sea, and is the
extreme part of our country on the right hand, when
we sail down the river Thames; and sailing round
the point into the British Channel is esteemed by
sailors rather dangerous. However, there was danger
enough to awaken the apprehensions of a freshwater
sailor. Yet here with some degree of confidence
in Him who exercises His power over the sea and
dry land, I laid me down and slept in quietness, while
the rattling waves drove against the sides of our
vessel, and the rustling winds shook our sails, and
made our yielding masts to speak. I was led to
reflect that now there was but a feeble plank between
me and the bottomless deep, yet, by a reliance on the
divine goodness, my fears were hushed, and a divine
calm prevailed within. “Thou will keep him in perfect
peace whose mind is staid on thee.” <i>Isaiah 26.&mdash;3.</i></p>

<p>‘On Saturday morning I awoke and heard a peaceful
sound from shore, which informed me it was two
o’clock; and, inquiring where we were, I found we
were safe anchored within the commodious harbour
of Ramsgate. Being so early an hour, we again
composed ourselves to sleep, and lay till five o’clock;
then leaving our sleeping apartment, and mounting
the peaceful deck&mdash;not like the frighted sailor, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
leaves the horrid hulk to view a thousand deaths from
winds, and waves, and rocks, without a friendly
shore in view&mdash;but to see one of the finest retreats
from all these dangers, which Providence has provided
for the safety of those who are exposed to the
violence and rage of angry elements. The commodious
Pier of Ramsgate seems admirably calculated
to shelter and protect vessels which are threatened
with destruction from winds and waves. This beautiful
piece of architecture is built in the form of a
Crescent, or half-moon, the points of which join to
the land.... The whole of this building of utility
appeared to bear a clear resemblance to the glorious
Mediator in his offices, who is appointed for a refuge
from the storm....</p>

<p>‘By six in the morning we went on shore, and joyfully
met our friends, who were brought down the
day before; but in their passage were overtaken by
a violent storm of thunder and lightning, whilst our
voyage was smooth and prosperous; but, in the
morning, we all met in peace and safety. Thus we
sat down to a friendly breakfast, and cheerfully talked
over the adventures of the little voyage. Something
like this, I think, may take place in the state of
blessedness.... While we were thus employed,
we consulted how to dispose of ourselves while we
continued at Ramsgate; we mutually agreed to form
ourselves into a little family, and though we could
not all lodge, yet we wished to board together in the
same house.’ This is a pleasing instance of <i>bonne
camaraderie</i> engendered, in a short time, among agreeable
companions.</p>

<p>‘In order to pursue the design of our coming, some
of our company mixed among the bathers at the seaside.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
The convenience of bathing, the coolness of a
fine summer’s morning, the agreeable appearance of
company so early, and the novelty of the scene, had
a very pleasing effect.... We began to look
around us; and though we were not presented with
objects of taste and elegance, yet the town and
environs afforded us some rural prospects, which
yielded both instruction and pleasure. Upon our left
hand, as we ascended from the sea-side, stands the
seat of observation, erected on a point of land, and
commanding an extensive prospect over that part of
the sea called the Downs, where you behold a number
of ships lying at anchor, or on their passage to
different parts of the world. From thence you may
likewise see the lofty cliffs of France, and reverberating
the light of the sun; while, at the same time, you
may, by way of amusement, watch the motions of
every boat coming in and going out of the harbour;
and, as the sea is always varying, its appearance altogether
affords an agreeable amusement. Here the
Company frequently stop to rest themselves after a
morning’s or an evening’s walk, and are sweetly
regaled by the cool refreshing breezes of the sea....</p>

<p>‘It might be thought strange was I to say nothing
of Margate, that being the chief resort for
bathers, and of growing repute. The town of Margate
is in a very increasing state, and its principal
ornaments consist of its late additions. The chief
concern of the publick seems to render it as much a
place for pleasure as utility, as, under colour of utility,
persons can pursue pleasure without censure. A
mother, for instance, might be highly blamed by her
acquaintance for leaving her family for a month, and
going to spend her husband’s money; but who can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
blame her when her health requires it? They are
modelling it according to the taste of the times.
They have, indeed, built one place of worship, but a
playhouse nearly four times as large. Thus, when
ill-health does not interrupt the company’s pursuit of
amusement, they are likely soon to be accommodated
to their minds. Such is the provision already made,
that the consumptive cough of a delicate lady may
be furnished with the relief of the fumes of a smoking
hot assembly-room, and the embarrassed citizen
may drown his anxiety in the amusements of the
Card-table....</p>

<p>‘The libraries are decently furnished, and may
serve as a kind of lounging Exchange, where persons
overburdened with money and time may ease
themselves with great facility. The most healthful
amusement, and best suited to invalids, that is pursued
at Margate, is that of the bowling-green, where,
upon the top of a hill, and in full prospect of the sea,
in a free open air, gentlemen may exercise their
bodies, and unbend their minds; this, if pursued for
the benefit of health and innocent recreation, with a
serious friend, appears to have no more criminality in
it than Peter’s going a fishing....</p>

<p>‘Having staid as long at Ramsgate as our affairs at
home would, with prudence, admit; we went on
board the same ship, and re-embarked for London.
In order, I suppose, to take the better advantage, we
sailed some leagues right out to sea; but, it being a
dead calm, we hardly experienced any other motion
than was occasioned by the tide and swell of the sea
for that night. The cry of the sailors, Blow! Blow!
reminded me of that pathetick exclamation of the
ancient Church! The next day proved equally calm,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
so that we had little else to divert us but walk about
the deck, and watch the rolling of the porpoises in
the sea. We had an old sailor on board, whose patience
being tired, declared he preferred being at
sea in a storm to being becalmed on the ocean, which
struck me with the propriety of the observation, when
applied to Christian experience; for a storm, under
Divine direction, is often made the means of hastening
the Christian’s progress, while a dead calm is useless
and unsafe.’</p>

<p>It took them two days to get to Margate, and another
day to reach Gravesend. On their way they
passed a vessel cast on shore, which ‘cut a dismal
figure, such as they make, to an enlightened eye, who
make shipwreck of faith, whom Christians see, as
they pursue their course, run aground, and dash to
pieces.’</p>

<p>By the time they came to Gravesend some of the
passengers had had enough of the Hoy&mdash;so they
hired a boat and four men to row them to London,
but the wind getting up, the river became rough, and
the boat being over-loaded, the boatmen begged
them to get on board a fishing-smack, which they
did, and arrived at Billingsgate safely. We can
hardly imagine, in these days of steam, that a journey
from Ramsgate to London would last from Monday
morning to Wednesday night, but people did not
hurry themselves too much in those days.

<h2 id="QUACKS_OF_THE_CENTURY">QUACKS OF THE CENTURY.</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i.jpg" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> all ages there have been pretenders to
medical science, and it has been reserved
to the present century to elevate
the healing art into a real science, based
on proper physiological facts, aided by
the searching analyses of modern chemistry. The
old alchemists had died out, yet they had some
pretensions to learning, but the pharmacopœia at
the commencement of the eighteenth century was in
a deplorable condition. Surgery, for rough purposes,
had existed since the earliest ages, because
accidents would happen, then as now; and, moreover,
there were wars, which necessitated the amputation
of limbs, etc., but medicine, except in the knowledge
of the virtue of herbs and simples, was in more than
a primitive state. Anyone who chose, could dub
himself Doctor, and, naturally, the privilege was
largely taken advantage of.</p>

<p>The name of quack, or quacksalver, does not
seem to have been much used before the seventeenth
century, and its derivation has not been distinctly
settled. In the ‘Antiquities of Egypt,’ etc., by William
Osburn, junior, London, 1847, p. 94, he says: ‘The
idea of a physician is frequently represented by a
species of duck, the name of which is CHIN: the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
Egyptian word for physician was also CHINI.’ But
neither Pierret, in his ‘Vocabulaire Hieroglyphique,’ nor
Bunsen, in ‘Egypt’s Place in Universal History,’
endorse this statement. Still the Egyptian equivalent
for cackling, or the noise of a goose, was <i>Ka ka</i>, and
in Coptic <i>Ouok</i>, pronounced very much like quack.</p>

<p>The Germans also use the word <i>Quacksalber</i>, and
the Dutch <i>Kwaksalver</i>, a term which Bilderdijk, in
his ‘Geslachtlijst der Naamwoorden,’ (derivation or gender
of men’s names) says, ought more properly to be
<i>Kwabsalver</i>, from <i>Kwab</i>, a wen, and <i>Salver</i>, to anoint.
Be this as it may, the English word quack certainly
means an illegitimate medical practitioner, a pretender
to medical science, whose pretensions are not
warranted by his knowledge.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century was prolific in quacks&mdash;a
notable example being John Wilmot, Earl of
Rochester. Both Bishop Burnet and De Gramont
agree that, during one of his banishments from Court,
he lived in Tower Street (next door to the sign of
the ‘Black Swan,’ at a goldsmith’s house), and there
practised as a quack doctor, as one Alexander Bendo,
newly arrived from Germany. There is a famous
mountebank speech of his extant, copies of which
exist not only in broad sheets, but in some of the
jest-books of the seventeenth century, which, genuine
or not, is very amusing. It is far too long to transcribe
here, but perhaps I may be pardoned if I give
a short extract.</p>

<p>‘The knowledge of these secrets I gathered in my
travels abroad (where I have spent my time ever
since I was fifteen years old to this, my nine and
twentieth year) in France and Italy. Those that
have travelled in Italy will tell you what a miracle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
of art does there assist nature in the preservation of
beauty: how women of forty bear the same countenance
with them of fifteen: ages are no way
distinguished by faces; whereas, here in England,
look a horse in the mouth and a woman in the face,
you presently know both their ages to a year. I
will, therefore, give you such remedies that, without
destroying your complexion (as most of your paints
and daubings do) shall render them perfectly fair;
clearing and preserving them from all spots, freckles,
heats, pimples, and marks of the small-pox, or any
other accidental ones, so that the face be not seamed
or scarred.</p>

<p>‘I will also cleanse and preserve your <i>teeth</i> white
and round as pearls, fastening them that are loose:
your gums shall be kept entire, as red as coral; your
lips of the same colour, and soft as you could wish
your lawful kisses.</p>

<p>‘I will likewise administer that which shall cure
the worst of breaths, provided the lungs be not
totally perished and imposthumated; as also certain
and infallible remedies for those whose breaths are
yet untainted; so that nothing but either a very
long sickness, or old age itself, shall ever be able to
spoil them.</p>

<p>‘I will, besides, (if it be desired) <i>take away</i> from
their fatness who have over much, and <i>add</i> flesh to
those that want it, without the least detriment to
their constitutions.’</p>

<p>By his plausible manners and good address, he
soon gathered round him a large <i>client&egrave;le</i> of servants,
etc., for he told fortunes as well as cured diseases.
These told their mistresses, and they too came to
consult the wise man. Even the Court ladies came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
<i>incognito</i> to see him, and <i>la belle</i> Jennings, sister to
the famous Sarah, first Duchess of Marlborough,
went, with the beautiful Miss Price, to have their
fortunes told, disguised as orange-wenches, and in
all probability their visit would never have been
heard of, had they not met with a disagreeable adventure
with a somewhat dissolute gentleman named
Brounker, who was gentleman of the chamber to the
Duke of York, and brother to Viscount Brounker,
President of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>John Cotgrave<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> thus describes the quack of his
time:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">To Doctor <i>Pulse-feel</i>.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Then there was that arch quack and empiric, Sir
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
Kenelm Digby, with his ‘sympathetic powder,’ etc.,
and Dr. Saffold, originally a weaver, who distributed
his handbills broadcast, advertising his ability to
cure every disease under the sun.</p>

<p>Also in this century is a poem called ‘The Dispensary,’<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
by Sir Samuel Garth, who lived in Queen
Anne’s time, which gives the following account of a
quack and his surroundings:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Medicine in the last century was very crude.
Bleeding and purging were matters of course; but
some of the remedies in the pharmacopœia were very
curious. Happy the patient who knew not the composition
of his dose. Take the following:<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>‘Or sometimes a quarter of a pint of the following
decoction may be drank alone four times a day:</p>

<p>‘Take a fresh viper, freed from the head, skin, and
intestines, cut in pieces; candied eryngo root, sliced,
two ounces. Boil them gently in three pints of
water, to a pint and three-quarters, and to the strained
liquor add simple and spiritous cinnamon waters, of
each two ounces. Mix them together, to be taken
as above directed.</p>

<p>‘The following viper broth (taken from the
London Dispensatory) is a very nutritious and proper
restorative food in this case, and seems to be one of
the best preparations of the viper: for all the benefit
that can be expected from that animal is by this
means obtained:</p>

<p>‘Take a middle-sized viper, freed from head, skin,
and intestines; and two pints of water. Boil them
to a pint and a half; then remove the vessel from the
fire; and when the liquor is grown cold, let the fat,
which congeals upon the surface, if the viper was
fresh, be taken off. Into this broth, whilst warm, put
a pullet of a moderate size, drawn and freed from the
skin, and all the fat, but with the flesh intire. Set the
vessel on the fire again, that the liquor may boil;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
then remove it from the fire, take out the chicken,
and immediately chop its flesh into little pieces: put
these into the liquor again, set it over the fire, and
as soon as it boils up, pour out the broth, first carefully
taking off the scum.</p>

<p>‘Of this broth let the patient take half a pint every
morning, at two of the clock in the afternoon, and at
supper-time.’</p>

<p>In the same book, also (p. 97), we find the following
remedy for cancer:</p>

<p>‘Dr. Heister, professor of physic and surgery in
the university of <i>Helmstadt</i> in <i>Germany</i>, with many
others, greatly extols the virtue of millepedes, or
wood-lice, in this case; and, perhaps, the best way of
administering them is as follows:</p>

<p>‘Take of live wood-lice, one ounce; fine sugar, two
drams; a little powder of nutmeg; and half a pint of
alexeterial water. Let the wood-lice and sugar, with
the nutmeg, be ground together in a marble mortar,
then gradually add the water, which being well
mixed, strain it with hard pressing. Two ounces of
this expression are to be taken twice a day, shaking
the vessel, so that no part of it may be lost.’</p>

<p>And it also seems that much virtue was attached
to the great number of component parts in a medicine,
as may be seen in the recipe for <i>Arquebusade Water</i><a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
(from the same book, p. 101).</p>

<p>‘Take of comfrey leaves and root, sage, mugwort,
bugloss, each four handfulls; betony, sanicle, ox-eye
daisy, common daisy, greater figwort, plantane,
agrimony, vervain, wormwood, fennel, each two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
handfulls; St. John’s wort, long birthwort, orpine,
veronica, lesser centaury, milfoil, tobacco, mouse-ear,
mint, hyssop, each one handfull; wine twenty-four
pounds. Having cut and bruised the herbs, pour on
them the wine, and let them stand together, in
digestion, in horse dung, or any other equivalent heat,
for three days: afterwards distill in an alembic with
a moderate fire.</p>

<p>‘This celebrated water has for some time been held
in great esteem, in contusions, for resolving coagulated
blood, discussing the tumors that arise on fractures
and dislocations, for preventing the progress of gangrenes,
and cleansing and healing ulcers and wounds,
particularly gunshot wounds....’</p>

<p>Amongst the empyrical medicines, the following is
much cried up by many people, as an infallible remedy:</p>

<p>‘Take two ounces of the worts that grow dangling
to the hinder heels of a stone horse,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> wash them in
common water, then infuse them in white wine all
night, and afterwards let them be dried, and reduced
to powder. The dose is half a dram twice a day, in
any proper vehicle. A dram of Venice soap given
twice a day, either in pills, or dissolved in some
proper liquor, is likewise said to cure a Cancer.’</p>

<p>In the early part of the eighteenth century, the
regular physicians were very ignorant. Ward<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> thus
describes them, and, although his language was
coarse, he was a keen observer.</p>

<p>‘They rail mightily in their Writings against the
ignorance of <i>Quacks</i> and <i>Mountebanks</i>, yet, for the
sake of <i>Lucre</i>, they Licence all the Cozening Pretenders
about Town, or they could not Practise;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
which shows it is by their Toleration that the People
are Cheated out of their Lives and Money; and yet
they think themselves so Honest, as to be no ways
answerable for this Publick Injury; as if they could
not kill People fast enough themselves, but must depute
all the Knaves in the Town to be Death’s Journeymen.
Thus do they License what they ought
carefully to Suppress; and Practise themselves what
they Blame and Condemn in others; And that the
Town may not be deceived by <i>Apothecaries</i>, they
have made themselves <i>Medicine-Mongers</i>,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> under a
pretence of serving the Publick with more faithful
preparations; in order to perswade the World to a
belief of which, they have publish’d Bills, where, in
the true <i>Quack’s</i> Dialect, they tell you the Poor shall
be supply’d for nothing; but whoever is so Needy as
to make a Challenge of their promise empty-handed,
will find, according to the <i>Mountebank’s</i> saying, <i>No
Money, No Cure</i>. The disposal of their Medicines
they leave to a Boy’s management, who scarce knows
<i>Mercurius Dulcis</i> from <i>White Sugar</i>, or <i>Mint Water</i>
from <i>Aqua Fortis</i>: So that People are likely to be
well serv’d, or Prescriptions truly observed by such
an Agent.’</p>

<p>If this was a faithful portrait of a physician in the
commencement of the century, what must a charlatan
have been? They sowed their hand-bills broadcast.
Gay, in his ‘Trivia,’ book ii., says,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘If the pale Walker pants with weak’ning Ills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sickly Hand is stor’d with Friendly Bills:<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></span>
<span class="i0">From hence he learns the seventh born<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> Doctor’s Fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hence he learns the cheapest Tailor’s name.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So universal was this practice of advertising that,
to quote Ward<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> once more, when talking of the
Royal Exchange, he says,</p>

<p>‘The Wainscote was adorn’d with Quacks’ Bills,
instead of Pictures; never an Emperick in the Town,
but had his Name in a Lacquered Frame, containing
a fair Invitation for a Fool and his Money to be soon
parted.’</p>

<p>The newspapers teemed with quack advertisements.
These, of course, we have; but we also have preserved
to us a quantity of the ephemeral hand-bills,
which, presumably, were kept on account of the
intrinsic merits they possessed. They are a curious
study. There was the ‘Oxford Doctor at the Fleet
Prison, near Fleet Bridge, London,’ who would sell
ten pills in a box for sixpence, warranted a cure for
the ‘<i>Scurvy</i>, <i>Dropsie</i>, and <i>Colt-evil</i>,’ would provide a
remedy for ‘<i>Headach</i>, <i>Sore Eyes</i>, <i>Toothach</i>, <i>Stomachach</i>,
<i>Bleeding</i>, <i>Scorbutick Gums</i>, <i>Black</i>, <i>Yellow</i>, <i>foul
Teeth</i>, <i>Cramp</i>, <i>Worms</i>, <i>Itch</i>, <i>Kibes</i>, <i>and Chilblains</i>; the
Price of each proper Specifick, Twopence. Teeth or
stumps of Teeth, Drawn with Ease and Safety, Let
Blood neatly, Issues or Setons Curiously made; <i>For
Two Pence each, and welcome</i>. By the Doctor that
puts forth this paper, you may be Taught Writing,
Arithmetick, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, at reasonable
Rates by the great, <i>Or Two Pence each of them by the
Week</i>.’ Presumably, as he does not advertise it, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
could not teach manners at the same traditional price.</p>

<p>There was another who sold the <i>Elixir Stomachum</i>
which was sold at the various coffee-houses about
town, and he complains thus: ‘☞ Garrowaye, the
Apple-man at the Exchange, who had it of me, to
sell, for five or six years, I have lately found out, is
Counterfeiting it, and have removed mine from him;
and what he now sells is a Counterfeit sort, and not
the Right, as was formerly Sold there.’</p>

<p>There was a man, living in Blackfriars, who was
so modest that he veiled his identity under the
initials R.C., who, from two in the afternoon till
night, ‘will give to all People a Secret how they
may utterly destroy <i>Buggs</i> without injury to their
Goods, at reasonable rates; do as you are Taught,
and if any be doubtful of the truth of it, they may
have full satisfaction of them that have Experienced it.’</p>

<p>Here is a gentleman who gives a minute address.
‘<i>In Petty France, Westminster, at a house with a black
dore</i>, and a Red Knocker, between the Sign of the
<i>Rose and Crown</i> and <i>Jacob’s Well</i>, is a <i>German</i> who
hath a Powder which, with the blessing of God upon
it, certainly cures the Stone, &amp;c.... If any person
of known Integrity will affirm that upon following their
directions the cure is not perfected, they shall have
their Money returned. Therefore be not unwilling
to come for help, but suspend your Judgment till you
have try’d, and then speak as you find.’</p>

<p>There is another, which may belong to the previous
century&mdash;but it is so hard to tell, either by means of
type or wood blocks&mdash;put forth by ‘<i>Salvator Winter</i>,
an <i>Italian</i> of the City of <i>Naples</i>, Aged 98 years, Yet,

part; Which first he attributes to God, and then to
his <i>Elixir Vit&aelig;</i>, which he always carries in his pocket
adayes, and at Night under his pillow; And when he
finds himself distemper’d, he taketh a Spoonful or
two, according as need requireth.‘ It is needless to
say that the <i>Elixir</i> was warranted to cure every evil
under the sun, including such diverse maladies as
catarrhs, sore eyes, hardness of hearing, toothache,
sore throat, consumption, obstructions in the stomach,
and worms. The net was arranged to catch every
kind of fish. In fact, his business was so profitable
that he had a successor, ‘<i>Salvator Winter, Junior</i>,’ who
says thus: ‘My father, aged 98 years, yet enjoys
his perfect health, which, next to the blessing of God,
he attributes to the <i>Elixir Vit&aelig;</i> having alway a
bottle of it in his pocket, drinking a spoonful thereof
four or five times a day; snuffing it very strongly
up his Nostrils, and bathing his Temples; thus by
prevention, he fortifies his vital Spirits.’</p>

<p>Nor did the sterner sex monopolise the profession
of quackdom, for ‘At the <i>Blew-Ball</i> in <i>Grays-Inn
Lane</i>, near <i>Holborn Barrs</i>, next Door to a <i>Tallow-Chandler</i>,
where you may see my Name upon a Board
over the Door, <i>liveth</i> Elizabeth Maris, <i>the True German
Gentlewoman</i> lately arrived.’ It seems that we were
much indebted to Germany for our quacks, for ‘At
the <i>Boot</i> and <i>Spatter dash</i>,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> next Door but One to the
<i>Vine Tavern</i>, in <i>Long-Acre</i>, near <i>Drury Lane</i>, Liveth
a German D<sup>r</sup>. and Surgeon, Who by the blessing of
GOD on his great Pains, Travels and Experience,
hath had wonderful Success in the Cure of the Diseases
following,’ &amp;c. There was also ‘<i>Cornelius &agrave;
Tilbourg</i>, Sworn Chirurgeon in <i>Ordinary</i> to K. <i>Charles</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
the II., to our late Sovereign K. <i>William</i>, as also to
Her present Majesty Queen <i>Ann</i>.’</p>

<p>A certain <i>John Choke</i>, whose motto was ‘<span class="smcap">Nothing
without God</span>,’ and was ‘an approved Physician; and
farther, Priviledged by his Majesty,’ advertised ‘an
Arcane which I had in <i>Germany</i>, from the Famous
and most Learned <i>Baptista Van Helmont</i>, of worthy
Memory (whose Daughter I Wedded), and whose
Prœscripts most Physicians follow.’</p>

<p>Curative and magical powers seem to have extended
from seventh sons of seventh sons to women&mdash;for
I find an advertisement, ‘At the Sign of the
<i>Blew-Ball</i>, at the upper end of <i>Labour in vain-Street</i>,
next <i>Shadwell-New-Market</i>, Liveth a Seventh Daughter,
who learn’d her Skill by one of the ablest Physicians
in <i>England</i> (her uncle was one of K. Charles’s
and K. James’s twelve Doctors), who resolves all
manner of Questions, and interprets Dreams to admiration,
and hath never fail’d (with God’s Blessing) what
she took in hand.’ Also there was a book published
late in the seventeenth century, called ‘The <span class="smcap">Woman’s
Prophecy</span>, or the Rare and Wonderful DOCTRESS,
foretelling a Thousand strange monstrous things that
shall come to pass before New Year’s day next, or
afterwards&mdash;. She likewise undertakes to cure the
most desperate Diseases of the Female Sex, as the
<i>Glim’ring of the Gizzard</i>, the <i>Quavering of the Kidneys</i>,
the <i>Wambling Trot</i>, &amp;c.’ A man who lived at the
‘Three Compasses’ in Maiden Lane, also issued a hand
bill that he would infallibly cure ‘several strange
diseases, which (though as yet not known to the
world) he will plainly demonstrate to any Ingenious
Artist to be the greatest Causes of the most common
Distempers incident to the Body of Man. The Names
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
of which take as follow: The <i>Strong Fives</i>, the <i>Marthambles</i>,
the <i>Moon-Pall</i>, the <i>Hockogrocle</i>.’</p>

<p>Then there was a medicine which was administered
to children even in my young days, ‘<span class="smcap">Daffy’s</span>
<i>famous</i> <span class="smcap">Elixir Salutis</span>, prepared by <i>Katharine Daffy</i>.
The finest now exposed to Sale, prepar’d from the
best Druggs, according to Art, and the Original
Receipt, which my Father, Mr. <i>Thomas Daffy</i>, late
Rector of <i>Redmile</i>, in the Valley of <i>Belvoir</i>, having
experienc’d the Virtues of it, imparted to his Kinsman,
Mr. <i>Anthony Daffy</i>, who publish’d the same to
the Benefit of the Community, and his own great
Advantage. This very Original Receipt is now in
my possession, left to me by my father aforesaid,
under his own Hand. My own Brother, Mr. <i>Daniel
Daffy</i>, formerly Apothecary in <i>Nottingham</i>, made this
ELIXIR from the same Receipt, and Sold it there
during his Life. Those, who know me, will believe
what I Declare; and those who do not, may be convinc’d
that I am no Countefeit, by the Colour, Tast,
Smell, and just Operation of my <span class="smcap">Elixir</span>.’ This was,
however, disputed by one John Harrison&mdash;and the
rivals of nearly two centuries ago, remind us forcibly
of the claimants to the original recipe of Bond’s
Marking Ink.</p>

<p>A man sold a useful medicine. ‘A most excellent
Eye Water, which cures in a very short time
all Distempers relating to the Eyes, from whatever
Cause soever they proceed, even tho’ they have been
of seven, eight, nine, or ten Years’ continuance....
This excellent Water effectually takes away all
Rabies or Pimples in the face, or any Part of the
Body; it also dissolves any small, or new-come Wens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
or Bunches under the Skin, so easily that it can
hardly be perceived.’</p>

<p>One quack blossomed forth in verse, and thus describes
himself: ‘<i>In</i> Cripplegate Parish, <i>in</i> Whitecross
Street, <i>almost at the farther End, near</i> Old Street <i>(turning
in by the sign of the</i> Black Croe, <i>in</i> Goat Alley,
<i>straightforward down three steps, at the sign of the</i> Blew

</div>

<p>Such ground as one did not cover, another did.
Take, for instance, the following: ‘In <i>Surry-Street</i>, in
the <i>Strand</i>, at the Corner House with a White-Balcony

<p>‘Hath a most excellent Wash to beautifie the

never so far gone, and all broke out in Blotches:
with many other Secrets in Physick, which you may
be satisfied in when you speak with her.... She
has an approved Remedy for Barrenness in Women.’</p>

<p>Very late in the preceding century (he died May
12, 1691), there was a most famous quack, Dr. Thomas
Saffold, one of whose handbills I give as a curiosity:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Dear Friends, let your Disease be what God will,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>‘By <i>Thomas Saffold</i>, an Approved and Licensed
Physician and Student in Astrology, who (through
God’s Mercy), to do good, still liveth at the <i>Black
Ball</i> and Old <i>Lilly’s Head</i>, next Door to the Feather-Shops
that are within <i>Black-fryers</i> Gate-way, which
is over against <i>Ludgate</i> Church, just by <i>Ludgate</i> in
<i>London</i>. Of him the Poor, Sore, Sick, and Lame may
have Advice for nothing, and proper Medicines for
every particular Distemper, at reasonable Rates ready
prepared, with plain Directions how to use them, to
cure either Men, Women, or Children of any Disease
or Diseases afflicting any Body, whether inward or
outward, of what Name or Nature soever (if Curable);
Also of this you may be sure, he hath Medicines to
prevent as well as Cure.</p>

<p>‘Lastly, He doth with great certainty and privacy:
Resolve all manner of Lawful Questions, according
to the Rules of Christian Astrology, and more than
Twenty One Years’ Experience.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>Talk of modern quacks&mdash;they are but second-rate
to Saffold! His <i>Pillul&aelig; Londinenses</i>, or London pills,
were advertised that ‘not only the meaner sort of
all Ages and each Sex, but people of Eminence, both
for their Rank in the World and their parts, have
found admirable success in taking these Pills.’</p>

<p>This <i>panacea</i> was warranted to cure ‘Gout, Dropsy,
Coma, Lethargy, Caries, Apoplexy, Palsy, Convulsions,
Falling Sickness, Vertigo, Madness, Catarrhs, Headache,
Scald, and Sore Heads, sore Eyes, Deafness,
Toothache, sore Mouth, sore and swollen Throat, foul
Stomach, bad Digestion, Vomiting, Pain at the Stomach,
sour Belching, Colic, Twisting of the Guts, Looseness,
Worms, all Obstructions of the Pancreas, of the Mesaraic
Veins, of the passages of the Chyle, and of the
Liver and Spleen, the Jaundice, Cachexy, Hypochondriac
Melancholy, Agues, Itch, Boils, Rheumatism,
Pains and Aches, Surfeits by Eating and Hard
Drinking, or by Heats and Colds (as some call
them).’</p>

<p>Then there comes a charming bit of candour
almost sufficient to disarm the unwary: ‘They are
also good in taking the Waters. I would not advise
them by any means in the Bloody Flux, nor in continual
Fevers, but they are good to purge after
either of those Diseases is over, or to carry off the
Humor aforehand. They must also be foreborn by
Women with Child. Otherwise they are good for
any Constitution, and in any Clime. They are
Durable many years, and good at Sea as well as on
Land.’</p>

<p>Thomas Saffold knew well the value of advertising,
and scattered his very varied handbills broadcast.
Presumably, like modern quacks, he made money.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
Of course he died, and his epitaph is as follows (he
originally was a weaver):</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Here lies the Corpse of Thomas Saffold,<br /></span>

<p>There was a harmless remedy advertised, even
though it was a fraud&mdash;and this was the loan, or sale,
of necklaces to be worn by children in teething.</p>

<h3>THE FAMOUS AND VIRTUOUS NECKLACES.</h3>

<p>‘One of them being of no greater weight than a
small <i>Nutmeg</i>, absolutely easing Children in Breeding
<i>Teeth</i> without <i>Pain</i>; thereby preventing <i>Feavers</i>, <i>Ruptures</i>,
<i>Convulsions</i>, <i>Rickets</i>, and such attendant Distempers,
to the Admiration of thousands of the City
of <i>London</i>, and Counties adjoining, who have experienced
the same, to their great comfort and satisfaction
of the Parents of the Children who have used
them. Besides the Decrease in the <i>Bills of Mortality</i>,
apparent (within this Year and a half) of above one
half of what formerly Dyed; and are now Exposed to
sale for the Publick good, at <i>five shillings</i> each <i>Necklace</i>,
&amp;c.’</p>

<p>Then there was a far higher-priced necklace, but,
as it also operated on adults, it was perhaps stronger
and more efficacious. ‘A necklace that cures all
sorts of fits in children, occasioned by Teeth or any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
other Cause; as also Fits in Men and Women. To
be had at Mr. Larance’s in Somerset Court, near Northumberland
House in the Strand; price ten shillings
for eight days, though the cure will be performed
immediately.’ And there was the famous ‘<i>Anodyne
Necklace</i>.’</p>

<p>In the preceding century there were some famous
quacks, notably Sir Kenelm Digby, who, with his
sympathetic powder, worked wonders, especially one
instance, an account of which he read to a learned
society at Montpellier. He recounted how a certain
learned gentleman, named Howell, found two of his
friends engaged in a duel with swords, how he rushed
to part them, and catching hold of one of their
blades, his hand was severely cut, the other antagonist
cutting him severely on the back of his hand.
Seeing the mischief they had done, they bound up
his hand with his garter, and took him home. Mr.
Howell was of such note that the King sent his own
physician to him, but without avail; and there was
expectation that the hand would mortify and have to
be amputated. Here Sir Kenelm, who knew him, stepped
in, and, being applied to by his friend to try his
remedies, consented. Let him tell his own tale.</p>

<p>‘I asked him then for anything that had blood
upon it; so he presently sent for his garter, wherewith
his hand was first bound, and as I called for a
basin of water, as if I would wash my hands, I took
a handful of powder of vitriol, which I had in my
study, and presently dissolved it. As soon as the
bloody garter was brought me, I put it in the basin,
observing, in the interim, what Mr. Howell did, who
stood talking with a gentleman in a corner of my chamber,
not regarding at all what I was doing. He started
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
suddenly, as if he had found some strange alteration
in himself. I asked him what he ailed.</p>

<p>‘“I know not what ails me; but I feel no more
pain. Methinks that a pleasing kind of freshness, as
it were a wet cold napkin, did spread over my hand,
which hath taken away the inflammation that tormented
me before.”</p>

<p>‘I replied, “Since, then, you feel already so much
good of my medicament, I advise you to cast away
all your plasters; only keep the wound clean, and in
a moderate temper, betwixt heat and cold.”</p>

<p>‘This was presently reported to the Duke of Buckingham,
and, a little after, to the King, who were
both very curious to know the circumstances of
the business; which was, that after dinner, I took
the garter out of the water, and put it to dry
before a great fire. It was scarce dry before Mr.
Howell’s servant came running, and saying that
his master felt as much burning as ever he had done,
if not more; for the heat was such as if his hand
were betwixt coals of fire. I answered that although
that had happened at present, yet he should find ease
in a short time; for I knew the reason of this new
accident, and would provide accordingly; for his
master should be free from that inflammation, it
might be, before he could possibly return to him;
but, in case he found no ease, I wished him to come
presently back again; if not, he might forbear coming.
Thereupon he went; and, at the instant, I did
put the garter again into the water; thereupon he
found his master without any pain at all. To be
brief, there was no sense of pain afterwards; but
within five or six days the wounds were cicatrized,
and entirely healed.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>Faith worked wonders, and a credulous imagination
formed an excellent foundation for healing. Take
another instance in the same century&mdash;the case of
Valentine Greatraks (who cured by the imposition of
hands), who was nearly contemporary with Sir
Kenelm. It would serve no good purpose to go
minutely into his history: suffice it to say that he
was an Irishman of good family, and, as a young
man, served under Cromwell. After the disbandment
of the army he was made Clerk of the Peace for the
County of Cork, Registrar for Transplantation (ejection
of Papists who would not go to church) and
Justice of the Peace, so that we see he occupied a
respectable position in society.</p>

<p>After Greatraks settled down in his civil capacity,
he seems to have been a blameless member of society;
but his religious convictions were extremely rabid,
and strong on the Protestant side. Writing in 1668,
he says: ‘About four years since I had an Impulse,
or a strange perswasion, in my own mind (of which
I am not able to give any rational account to another)
which did very frequently suggest to me that there
was bestowed on me the gift of curing the King’s
Evil: which, for the extraordinariness of it, I thought
fit to conceal for some time, but at length I communicated
this to my Wife, and told her, That I did
verily believe that God had given me the blessing of
curing the King’s Evil; for, whether I were in private
or publick, sleeping or waking, still I had the same
Impulse; but her reply was to me, That she conceived
this was a strange imagination: but, to prove
the contrary, a few daies after there was one <i>William
Maher</i> of <i>Salterbridge</i>, in the Parish of <i>Lissmore</i>, that
brought his Son <i>William Maher</i> to my house, desiring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
my Wife to cure him, who was a person ready to
afford her Charity to her Neighbours, according to
her small skill in Chirurgery; on which my Wife told
me there was one that had the King’s Evil very
grievously in the Eyes, Cheek, and Throat; whereupon
I told her that she should now see whether
this were a bare fancy, or imagination, as she thought
it, or the Dictates of God’s Spirit on my heart; and
thereupon I laid my hands on the places affected,
and prayed to God for Jesus’ sake to heal him, and
then I bid the Parent two or three days afterwards
to bring the Child to me again, which accordingly he
did, and then I saw the Eye was almost quite whole,
and the Node, which was almost as big as a Pullet’s
Egg, was suppurated, and the throat strangely
amended, and, to be brief (to God’s glory I speak it),
within a month discharged itself quite, and was perfectly
healed, and so continues, God be praised.’</p>

<p>This may be taken as a sample of his cures, albeit
his first; and, although he excited the enmity of the
licensed medical profession, he seems to have cured
the Countess of Conway of an inveterate head-ache,
which greatly enhanced his reputation. He died no
one knows when, but some time early in the century.</p>

<p>And in our time, too, have been the quacks, the
Zouave Jacob and Dr. Newton, who pretended to
have the miraculous gift of healing by the imposition
of hands, so that we can scarcely wonder that, in an
age when the dissemination of accurate and scientific
knowledge as the present is (imperfect though
it be), a man like Valentine Greatraks was believed
in as of almost divine authority at the period at
which he lived. But it is a very curious thing that
some men either imagine that they have, or feign to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
have a miraculous gift of healing. Witness in our
own day the ‘Peculiar People,’ who base their peculiar
gift of healing on a text from the Epistle of St.
James, chap. 5, v. 14&mdash;‘Is any sick among you? let
him call upon the elders of the Church; and let them
pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name
of the Lord.’</p>

<p>So also the <i>Catholic and Apostolic Church</i> (Irvingites)
teach this practice as a dogma, vide their
catechism,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> ‘What are the benefits to be derived
from this rite?’ ‘St. James teaches us again that
the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
shall raise him up; and, if he have committed sins,
they shall be forgiven him.’ After this, who can say
that the age of faith is passed away?</p>

<p>With them, also, is a great function for the benediction
of oil for anointing the sick; the rubric for
which is as follows:<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> ‘In the Celebration of the Holy
Eucharist on a Week-day, immediately before the
elements are brought up and placed on the Altar, the
Elder or Elders present shall bring the vessel containing
the oil to the Angel, who shall present it
uncovered upon the Altar; and then kneeling down
at the Altar, and the Elders kneeling down at the
access to the Sanctuary, the Angel shall say this
<span class="smcap">Prayer of Benediction</span>.’</p>

<p>Here follows a not very long prayer, in which the
Almighty is intreated to impart to the oil the virtue
which is dogmatically asserted that it possesses, in
the catechism. The rubric then continues, ‘The oil
which has been blessed shall remain on the Altar until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
after the Service, and shall then be delivered by the
Angel to the senior Elder, that it may be reverently
carried to the Sacristy, and there deposited in the
proper place by the Angel.’</p>

<p>In the ‘Order for anointing the Sick’ (p. 602), the
rubric says: ‘This rite shall be administered only to
such as have, in time past, received the Holy Communion,
or to whom it is intended presently to
administer the Communion; also, only in such cases
of sickness as are of a serious or dangerous character.
In order to the receiving of the rite, opportunity
should, if possible, be previously given to the sick
person to make confession of his sins.</p>

<p>‘A table should be provided in the sick person’s
room, with a clean cloth thereon, upon which may be
placed the vessel of holy oil.... The Elder in
charge shall be accompanied, when possible, by the
other Elders, the Pastor, and the Deacon.’</p>

<p>A somewhat lengthy service follows, and in the
middle is this rubric: ‘Then the Elders present shall
anoint the sick person with the oil on the head or
forehead, and, if the sick person request it, also on
any part affected.’ And it winds up with the subjoined
direction, ‘All the holy oil that shall remain
after the anointing shall be forthwith consumed by
Fire.’</p>

<p>I had intended to confine my subject entirely to
English quacks, but the name of Mesmer is so allied
to quackery in England that I must needs refer to
him. He was born at Merseburg in Germany on
May 23, 1733, and died at the same place March 5,
1815. He studied medicine, and took a doctor’s
degree in 1766. He started his extraordinary theory
in 1772 by publishing a tract entitled, ‘<i>De Planetarium</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
<i>Influxu</i>,’ in which he upheld that tides exist in the
air as in the sea, and were similarly produced. He
maintained that the sun and the moon acted upon
an etherial fluid which penetrated everything, and
this force he termed <i>Animal Magnetism</i>. But there is
every reason to believe that he was indebted for his
discovery to a Jesuit father named Hel, who was
professor of astronomy at Vienna. Hel used peculiarly
made steel plates, which he applied to different
portions of his patient’s body. Hel and Mesmer
subsequently quarrelling about the prior discovery
of each, the latter discontinued the use of the plates,
and substituted his fingers. Then he found it was
unnecessary to touch his patient, but that the same
magnetic influence could be induced by waving his
hands, and making what are called <i>mesmeric passes</i> at
a distance.</p>

<p>But the Viennese are a practical race, and his
failures to cure, notably in one case, that of Mademoiselle
Paradis (a singer), who was blind, caused
charges of deceit to be brought against him, and he
was told to leave Vienna at a day’s notice. He
obeyed, and went to Paris, where he set up a superb
establishment, fitted up most luxuriously. The novelty-loving
Parisians soon visited him, and here, in a dimly
lit room, with pseudo-scientific apparatus to excite
the imagination, and a great deal of corporal manipulation,
tending to the same purpose, to the accompaniment
of soft music or singing, hysterical women went
into convulsive fits, and laughed, sobbed, and shrieked,
according to their different temperaments.</p>

<p>Having reached this stage, Mesmer made his
appearance, clad in a gold embroidered robe of
violet silk, holding in his hand a magnetic rod of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
wondrous power. With slow and solemn steps he
approached his patients, and the exceeding gravity
of his deportment, added to their ignorance of what
might be coming next, generally calmed and subdued
those who were not insensible. Those who had lost
their senses he awoke by stroking them, and tracing
figures upon their bodies with his magnetic wand,
and, on their recovery, they used to testify to the
great good his treatment had done them.</p>

<p>A commission of scientific and medical men sat to
make inquiry into ‘Animal Magnetism,’ and they reported
adversely. He then endeavoured to get a
pecuniary recognition of his services from the French
Government, but this being declined, he retired to
Spa, where, the bubble having been pricked, he lived
for some time in comparative obscurity.</p>

<p>Mesmerism was introduced into England in the
year 1788, by a Dr. De Mainauduc, who, on his
arrival at Bristol, delivered lectures on ‘Animal
Magnetism’; and, as his somewhat cautious biographer,
Dr. George Winter, observes, he ‘was reported to
have cured diseased persons, <i>even</i> without the aid of
medicines, and of his having the power of treating
and curing diseased persons at a distance.’ He found
many dupes, for the said authority remarks, ‘On
looking over the lists of Students that had been, or
then were under the Doctor’s tuition, it appeared that
there was 1 Duke&mdash;1 Duchess&mdash;1 Marchioness&mdash;2
Countesses&mdash;1 Earl&mdash;1 Lord&mdash;3 Ladies&mdash;1 Bishop&mdash;5
Right Honourable Gentlemen and Ladies&mdash;2
Baronets&mdash;7 Members of Parliament&mdash;1 Clergyman&mdash;2
Physicians&mdash;7 Surgeons&mdash;exclusive of 92 Gentlemen
and Ladies of respectability, in the whole 127.</p>

<p>‘Naturally fond of study, and my thirst after knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
being insatiable, I also was allured to do myself
the honour of adding my name to the list; and to
investigate this very extraordinary Science: and, according
to the general terms, I paid 25 Guineas to
the Doctor, and 5 Guineas for the use of the Room; I
also signed a bond for &pound;10,000, and took an affidavit
that I would not discover the secrets of the Science
<i>during the Doctor’s natural life</i>.’</p>

<p>So we see that this wonderful power had a market
value of no mean consideration, and, indeed, an
anonymous authority, who wrote on ‘Animal Magnetism,’
states that Dr. Mainauduc realised &pound;100,000.
So lucrative was its practice, that many pretenders
sprung up, notable one Holloway who gave lectures
at the rate of five guineas the course, besides Miss
Prescott, Mrs. Pratt, Monsieur de Loutherbourg the
painter, Mr. Parker, and Dr. Yeldal; but the chief of
these quacks was Dr. Loutherbourg, who was assisted
in his operations by his wife. A book about his
wonderful cures was written by one of his believers,
Mary Pratt, ‘A lover of the Lamb of God,’ in which
he is described as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> ‘A Gentleman of superior abilities,
well known in the scientific and polite Assemblies for
his brilliancy of talents as a Philosopher, and Painter:
this Gentleman is no other than Mr. De Loutherbourg,
who with his Lady, Mrs. De Loutherbourg,
have been made by the Almighty power of the Lord
Jehovah, proper Recipients to receive divine Manuductions,
which heavenly and divine Influx coming
from the Radix <i>God</i>, his divine Majesty has most
graciously condescended to bestow on them (<i>his
blessing</i>) to diffuse healing to <i>all</i> who have faith in
the Lord as mediator, be they Deaf, Dumb, Lame,
Halt, or Blind.’
</p>

<p>That thousands flocked to these charlatans is undoubted,
for Dr. George Winter (above quoted) says,
‘It was credibly reported that 3,000 persons have
attended at one time, to get admission at Mr. Loutherbourg’s,
at Hammersmith; and that some persons sold
their tickets for from One, to Three Guineas each.’
And this is corroborated by crazy Mary Pratt. ‘Report
says three Thousand People have waited for
Tickets at a time. For my own part, the Croud was
so immense that I could with difficulty gain the Door
on Healing Days, and I suppose, upon conviction, Report
spoke Truth.’ De Loutherbourg charged nothing
for his cures, and Mary Pratt is extremely
scandalized at those who, having received a ticket
gratis, sold them from two to five guineas.</p>

<p>Many cases are given in her book of the cures
effected by this benevolent couple; how the blind
were made to see, the deaf to hear, the lame to walk,
or the dumb to speak&mdash;nay, could even cast out
devils&mdash;as the following testimonial will show.</p>

<p>‘The second case I shall mention is that of a
woman possessed with Evil Spirits, her name Pennier,
lives at No. 33 Ogle Street, Mary-le-bone, near Portland-Chapel;
her husband lives with the French
Ambassador: her case was too terrific to describe;
her eyes and mouth distorted, she was like a Lunatic
in every sense of the word; she used to say that it
was not her voice that spoke, but the devil in her.
In short, her case was most truly distressing, not only
to her family, but the neighbourhood; she used to invite
people in with apparent civility, then bite them,
and scratch like a cat; nay, she would beg a pin of
women, and then scratch them with it, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. De Loutherbourg, a lady of most exquisite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
sensibility and tenderness, administered to this Mrs.
Pennier; she daily amended, and is now in her right
mind, praising God, who has through his servant
performed such an amazing cure, to the astonishment
of hundreds who saw her and heard her.’</p>

<p>Mrs. De Loutherbourg’s system of cure was extremely
simple, as this example will show: ‘Mrs.
Hook, Stable Yard, St. James’s, has two daughters,
born Deaf and Dumb. She waited on the Lady above
mentioned, who looked on them with an eye of benignity,
and healed them. (I heard both of them
speak.)’</p>

<p>Her husband’s plan was rather more clumsy. He
imposed hands. ‘A News-Carrier at Chelsea cured of
an Abscess in his Side. Mr. De Loutherbourg held
his hand on the Abscess half a minute, and it broke
immediately.’</p>

<p>Perhaps these cures were not permanent, for ‘Mr.
De Loutherbourg told me he had cured by the blessing
of God, two Thousand since Christmas. But, as
our Lord said, of the ten healed, one only returned
to thank him; so many hundreds have acted, that
have never returned to Mr. De Loutherbourg.’</p>

<p>One of the most impudent of these quacks was
named Benjamin Douglas Perkins, whose father
claimed to be the inventor of the metallic tractors,
which were rods made either of a combination of
copper, zinc, and gold, or of iron, silver, and platinum,
and he explains, in the specification to his patent,
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span> ‘the point of the instrument thus formed, I
apply to those parts of the body which are affected
with diseases, and draw them off on the skin, to a
distance from the complaint, and usually towards the
extremities.’
</p>

<p>He charged the moderate sum of five guineas a set
for these precious instruments, and made a good
thing out of them. He was a member of the Society
of Friends, and, as a proof that his charlatanism was
believed in, this benevolent society subscribed largely,
and built for him the <i>Perkinean Institution</i>, an
hospital where the poor could be treated on his
system, free of cost.</p>

<p>He was an adept in the art of puffing, and his
‘Testimonials’ are quite equal to those of modern
times. I will only cite two. ‘My little infant child
was <i>scalded</i> with hot tea on the forehead, about three
and a half inches in length, and three-fourths of an
inch in breadth, which raised a vesicle before I had
time to apply anything to it. The <i>Tractors</i> were
solely used, and the whole redness disappeared. The
Blister broke, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>‘A lady fell from her horse, and <i>dislocated</i> her
ancle, which remained several hours before it was
reduced, by which it became very much <i>swelled</i>, <i>inflamed</i>,
and <i>painful</i>. Two or three applications of the
<i>Tractor</i> relieved the pain, and in a day or two she
walked the house, and had no further complaint.’</p>

<p>Then also was Dominicetti, who, in 1765, established
a house in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, for medicated
baths, but he hardly belongs to the magnetisers.
Then there was Katterfelto, but he, too, hovers on the
borderland of quackism&mdash;vide the following one of
hundreds of advertisements.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<p>He was a charlatan <i>pur et simple</i>, and to his other
attractions he added a performing black cat,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> ‘but
Colonel Katterfelto is very sorry that many persons
will have it that he and his famous <span class="smcap">Black Cat</span> were

thousands could not receive admission lately for want
of room, and Katterfelto expects to clear at least
above &pound;30,000, in a year’s time, through his Solar
Microscope and surprizing Black Cat.’</p>

<p>He also invented a sort of lucifer-match.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> ‘Dr.

it, and is more useful to the Nation than 30,000 Air
Balloons. It will light 900 candles, pistols or cannons,
and never misses. He also sells the very best
Solid, Liquid, and Powder Phosphorus, Phosphorus
Matches, Diamond Beetles, &amp;c.’ Katterfelto died at
Bedale, in Yorkshire, 25th of November, 1799.</p>

<p>There also lived Dr. Graham, who was not heard
of before 1780, and he was an arch quack. About
that year he took a mansion in the Royal Terrace,
Adelphi, which he fitted up sumptuously. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
inscribed ‘Templum &AElig;sculapio Sacrum,’ and was
called both the ‘Temple of Health,’ and the ‘Hymeneal
Temple.’ Here, in air heavy with incense, he
lectured on electricity and magnetism. He was a
past master in the art of puffing, and published
several books in glorification of himself. In one,
called ‘<span class="smcap">Medical Transactions</span> at the Temple of
Health in London, in the course of the years 1781 &amp;
1782,’ he gives a wonderful list of cures worked
by his ‘Electrical &AElig;ther, Nervous &AElig;thereal Balsam,
Imperial Pills, Liquid Amber, British Pills,’ and his
‘Bracing, or Restorative Balsam,’ which, in order to
bring within the reach of ordinary people, he kindly
consented to sell at half-price, namely, ‘that the
bottles marked, and formerly sold at one guinea, may
<i>now</i> be had at only half-a-guinea; the half-guinea
bottles at five shillings and threepence; the five
shilling at half-a-crown, and the two-and-sixpenny
vials at <i>only one shilling and threepence</i>.’</p>

<p>In this book, too, are some choice specimens of
poetry, all laudatory of Dr. Graham, one of which is
worth repeating, as a specimen&mdash;</p>

<p>In this temple of ‘Health and Hymen’ he had a
wonderful ‘Celestial Bed,’ which he pretended cost
sixty thousand pounds. He guaranteed that the
sleepers therein, although hitherto childless, should
become prolific; but it was somewhat costly, for the
fee for its use for a single night was one hundred
pounds. Still, he had some magneto-electric beds,
which, probably, were as efficacious, at a lower rate,
only fifty pounds nightly. The title-page of a
pamphlet on his establishment is noteworthy.</p>

<p>The ‘<span class="smcap">Vestina</span>, or Goddess of Health,’ was no mean
person. She began life as a domestic servant, and
was named Emma Lyons. She was a good-looking,
florid, buxom wench, and, after having played her
part as priestess at the ‘Temple of Health and
Hymen,’ became the wife of the dilletante Sir William
Hamilton, English Minister at Naples, and was afterwards
notorious for her connection with Lord Nelson.</p>

<p>Graham wrote in 1790, ‘A short Treatise on the
All cleansing&mdash;all healing&mdash;and all invigorating
Qualities of the <span class="smcap">Simple Earth</span>, when long and
repeatedly applied to the naked Human Body and
Lungs, for the safe, speedy, and radical Cure of all
Diseases, internal as well as external, which are, in
their Nature or Stage, susceptible of being cured;&mdash;for
the preservation of the Health, Vigour, Bloom,
and Beauty of Body and of Mind; for rejuvenating
the aged and decaying Human Body;&mdash;and for prolonging
Life to the very longest possible Period, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who would try the doctor’s
earth-cure, I extract the following: ‘I generally,
or always, prefer the sides or tops of hills or mountains,
as the air and the earth are the more pure and
salubrious; but the air and earth of ordinary pasture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
or corn-fields, especially those that are called upland,
and even good clean garden-ground, or the higher
commons, especially fallow corn-fields, are all salutary
and good.</p>

<p>‘As to the colour and nature of the earth or soil, I
prefer a good brown or reddish blooming mould, and
light, sandy, crumbly, mellow and marrowy earth; or
that which feels when I am in it, and crumbling with
my hands and fingers, like bits of marrow among
fine Flour; and that which has a strong, sweet,
earthly smell&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>So that my readers now know exactly what to do.</p>

<p>He had a fairly comprehensive idea of modern
hygiene, as will be seen from the following extract
from ‘General Instructions to the persons who consult
Dr. Graham as a Physician’:</p>

<p>‘It will be unreasonable for Dr. Graham’s Patients
to expect a complete and a lasting cure, or even
great alleviation of their peculiar maladies, unless
they keep the body and limbs most perfectly clean
with very frequent washings,&mdash;breathe fresh, open
air day and night,&mdash;be simple in the quality and
moderate in the quantity of their food and drink,&mdash;and
totally give up using the deadly poisons and
weakeners of both body and soul, and the cankerworm
of estates called foreign Tea and Coffee, Red
Port Wine, Spirituous Liquors, Tobacco and Snuff,
gaming and late hours, and all sinful, unnatural, and
excessive indulgence of the animal appetites, and of
the diabolical and degrading mental passions. On
practising the above rules&mdash;on a widely open window
day and night&mdash;and on washing with cold water,
and going to bed every night by eight or nine, and
rising by four or five, depends the very perfection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
of bodily and mental health, strength and happiness.’</p>

<p>He wrote many pamphlets, some of them on religious
matters, and the fools who patronised him paid
him large fees; yet his expenses were very heavy,
and his manner of living luxurious, so that we experience
but little wonder when we find the ‘Temple
of Health’ sold up, and that Graham himself died
poor&mdash;either in, or near, Glasgow.</p>

<p>Early in the century there were (in surgery) two
noted quacks, namely, Dr. (afterwards Sir William)
Read, and Roger, or, as he called himself, Doctor,
Grant&mdash;both oculists. Read originally was a tailor,
and Grant had been a tinker and Anabaptist preacher.
The list of cures of both are marvellous&mdash;Grant even
advertising in the <i>Daily Courant</i>, of July 20, 1709,
that he had cured, in five minutes, a young man that
had been born blind. But at that time, when people
believed in their sovereign being able to cure scrofula
by touching the patient with a gold coin, a little
faith went a long way.</p>

<p>But quackery was not confined to the masculine
gender&mdash;the ladies competed with them in the field.
Notably Mrs. Map, the bone-setter of Epsom, of whom
Mr. Pulteney writes so amusingly to Swift on December
21, 1736: ‘I must tell you a ridiculous
incident; perhaps you have not heard it. One Mrs.
Mapp, a famous she bone-setter and mountebank,
coming to town with a coach and six horses, on the
Kentish road, was met by a rabble of people, who,
seeing her very oddly and tawdrily dressed, took her
for a foreigner, and concluded she must be a certain
great person’s mistress. Upon this they followed the
coach, bawling out, “No Hanover w&mdash;&mdash;! No
Hanover w&mdash;&mdash;!” The lady within the coach was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
much offended, let down the glass, and screamed
louder than any of them, “She was no Hanover
w&mdash;&mdash;! she was an English one!” Upon which they
cried out, “God bless your ladyship!” quitted the
pursuit, and wished her a good journey.’</p>

<p>This woman sprang into notoriety all at once.
The first authentic account of her is on page 457
of the <i>London Magazine</i> for 1836, under the date of
August 2: ‘The Town has been surprized lately with
the fame of a young woman at <i>Epsom</i>, who, tho’ not
very regular, it is said, in her Conduct, has wrought
such Cures that seem miraculous in the Bone-setting
way. The Concourse of People to <i>Epsom</i> on this
occasion is incredible, and ’tis reckon’d she gets near
20 Guineas a Day, she executing what she does in a
very quick Manner: She has strength enough to put
in any Man’s Shoulder without any assistance; and
this her strength makes the following Story the more
credible. A Man came to her, sent, as ’tis supposed,
by some Surgeons, on purpose to try her Skill, with
his Hand bound up, and pretended his Wrist was put
out, which upon Examination she found to be false;
but, to be even with him for his Imposition, she gave
it a Wrench, and really put it out, and bad him <i>go to
the Fools who sent him, and get it set again</i>, or, if he would
come to her that day month, she would do it herself.</p>

<p>‘This remarkable person is Daughter to one <i>Wallin</i>,
a Bone-setter of <i>Hindon, Wilts</i>. Upon some family
Quarrel, she left her Father, and Wander’d up and
down the Country in a very miserable Manner, calling
herself <i>Crazy Salley</i>. Since she became thus
famous, she married one Mr. <i>Hill Mapp</i>, late servant
to a Mercer on <i>Ludgate Hill</i>, who, ’tis said, soon left
her, and carried off &pound;100 of her Money.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<p>She was not long making her way in the world,
for we read in the same magazine, under date, September
19, 1736: ‘Mrs. <i>Mapp</i>, the famous Bone-setter
at <i>Epsom</i>, continues making extraordinary Cures.
She has now set up an Equipage, and this Day came
to <i>Kensington</i> and waited on her Majesty.’</p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, under date of August
31, 1736, gives a similar account of her private life,
adding that her husband did not stay with her above
a fortnight, but adds that she was wonderfully clever
in her calling, having ‘cured Persons who have been
above 20 years disabled, and has given incredible
Relief in most difficult cases.’</p>

<p>At this time she was at her acme&mdash;but if an anonymous
writer in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> for March, 1873,
p. 82, is to be believed, she died December, 1837, ‘at
her lodgings near Seven Dials, so miserably poor, that
the parish was obliged to bury her.’</p>

<p>In No. 572 of the <i>Spectator</i>, July 26, 1714,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> is a very
amusing article on the quacks of Queen Anne’s time:</p>

<p>‘There is scarce a city in Great Britain but has one
of this tribe, who takes it into his protection, and on
the market-day harangues the good people of the
place with aphorisms and receipts. You may depend
upon it he comes not there for his own private
interest, but out of a particular affection to the town.
I remember one of these public-spirited artists at
Hammersmith, who told his audience that he had been
born and bred there, and that, having a special
regard for the place of his nativity, he was determined
to make a present of five shillings to as many
as would accept of it. The whole crowd stood agape
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
and ready to take the doctor at his word; when, putting
his hand into a long bag, as everyone was expecting
his crown piece, he drew out a handful of
little packets, each of which, he informed the spectators,
was constantly sold at five shillings and sixpence,
but that he would bate the odd five shillings
to every inhabitant of that place; the whole assembly
immediately closed with this generous offer, and
took off all his physick, after the doctor had made
them vouch for one another, that there were no foreigners
among them, but that they were all Hammersmith
men.</p>

<p>‘There is another branch of pretenders to this art,
who, without either horse or pickle herring,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> lie snug
in a garret, and send down notice to the world of their
extraordinary parts and abilities by printed bills and
advertisements. These seem to have derived their
custom from an eastern nation which Herodotus
speaks of, among whom it was a law that whenever
any cure was to be performed, both the method of the
cure, and an account of the distemper, should be fixed
in some public place; but, as customs will corrupt,
these, our moderns, provide themselves with persons
to attest the cure before they publish or make an
experiment of the prescription. I have heard of a
porter, who serves as a Knight of the post<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> under one
of these operators, and, though he was never sick in
his life, has been cured of all the diseases in the Dispensary.
These are the men whose sagacity has
invented elixirs of all sorts, pills and lozenges, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
take it as an affront if you come to them before you
have been given over by everybody else. Their
medicines are infallible, and never fail of success;
that is, of enriching the doctor, and setting the
patient effectually at rest.</p>

<p>‘I lately dropt into a coffee-house at Westminster,
where I found the room hung round with ornaments
of this nature. There were Elixirs, Tinctures, the
Anodyne Fotus, English Pills, Electuaries, and, in
short, more remedies than I believe there are diseases.
At the sight of so many inventions, I could not but
imagine myself in a kind of arsenal or magazine, where
a store of arms was deposited against any sudden
invasion. Should you be attacked by the enemy
sideways, here was an infallible piece of defensive
armour to cure the pleurisy; should a distemper beat
up your head-quarters, here you might purchase an
impenetrable helmet, or, in the language of the artist,
a cephalic tincture; if your main body be assaulted,
here are various kinds of armour in case of various
onsets. I began to congratulate the present age
upon the happiness man might reasonably hope for
in life, when death was thus in a manner defeated,
and when pain itself would be of so short a duration,
that it would just serve to enhance the value of
pleasure.</p>

<p>‘While I was in these thoughts, I unluckily called
to mind a story of an ingenious gentleman of the
last age, who, lying violently afflicted with the gout,
a person came and offered his services to cure him
by a method which, he assured him, was infallible;
the servant who received the message carried it up
to his master, who, inquiring whether the person
came on foot or in a chariot, and being informed that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
he was on foot: “Go,” says he, “send the knave
about his business; was his method infallible as he
pretends, he would, long before now, have been in his
coach and six.” In like manner I concluded that, had
all these advertisers arrived to that skill they pretend
to, they would have no need, for so many years successively,
to publish to the world the place of their
abode, and the virtues of their medicines. One of
these gentlemen, indeed, pretends to an effectual
cure for leanness: what effects it may have had upon
those who have tried it, I cannot tell; but I am
credibly informed that the call for it has been so
great, that it has effectually cured the doctor himself
of that distemper. Could each of them produce so
good an instance of the success of his medicines,
they might soon persuade the world into an opinion
of them.</p>

<p>‘I observe that most of the bills agree in one
expression, viz., that, “with God’s blessing,” they
perform such and such cures: this expression is certainly
very proper and emphatical, for that is all they
have for it. And, if ever a cure is performed on a
patient where they are concerned, they can claim a
greater share than Virgil’s <span class="smcap">Iapis</span> in the curing of
<span class="smcap">&AElig;neas</span>; he tried his skill, was very assiduous about
the wound, and, indeed, was the only visible means
that relieved the hero, but the poet assures us it was
the particular assistance of a deity that speeded the
whole operation.’</p>

<p>There was another female quack in 1738, one Mrs.
Stephens, and in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for that
year, p. 218, we read that ‘Mrs. <i>Stephens</i> has proposed
to make her Medicines for the Stone publick, on Consideration
of the sum of &pound;5,000 to be rais’d by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
Contribution, and lodged with Mr. <i>Drummond</i>, <i>Banker</i>.
He has receiv’d since the 11th of this month (April)
about &pound;500 on that Account.’ She advertised her
cures very fully, and she obtained and acknowledged,
as subscriptions from April 11 to the end of December,
1738, the receipt of &pound;1,356 3s. (<i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i>, 1739, p. 49). And the subscribers were of
no mean quality; they included five bishops, three
dukes, two duchesses, four earls, two countesses, five
lords, and of smaller fry a vast quantity. But this
did not satisfy her; she had influence enough to get
a short Act of Parliament passed in her favour (Cap.
23, 12, Geo. II., 1739), entitled:</p>

<p>‘<i>An Act for providing a reward</i> to Joanna Stephens
<i>upon a proper discovery to be made by her for the use of
the publick, of the medicines prepared by her for the cure
of the stone.</i></p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Whereas</span> <i>Joanna Stevens</i> (sic) of the City of
<i>Westminster</i>, spinster, hath acquired the knowledge
of medicines, and the skill of preparing them, which
by a dissolving power seem capable of removing the
cause of the painful distemper of the stone, and may
be improved, and more successfully applied when the
same shall be discovered to persons learned in the
science of physick; now, for encouraging the said
<i>Joanna Stephens</i> to make discovery thereof, and for
providing her a recompence in case the said medicines
shall be submitted to the examination of proper
judges, and by them be found worthy of the reward
hereby provided; may it please your Majesty, that it
be enacted, etc.</p>

<p>‘&pound;5,000 granted out of the supplies for the discovery
of Mrs. Stephens’s medicines. Treasury to
issue the said sum on a proper certificate.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span></p>

<p>A committee of twenty scientists investigated her
medicines, and reported favourably on them. They
were trifold. A powder, a draught, and a pill&mdash;and
what think you they were made of? The powder
was made of egg-shells and snails, both burnt; the
draught was made of Alicante soap, swine’s cresses
burnt, and honey. This was made into a ball, which
was afterwards sliced and dissolved in a broth composed
of green camomile, or camomile flowers, sweet
fennel, parsley, and burdock leaves, boiled in water
and sweetened with honey; whilst the pill was compounded
of snails, wild carrot seeds, burdock seeds,
ashen keys, hips and haws, all burnt to blackness, and
then mixed with Alicante soap! These were the
famous remedies for which a grateful nation paid
such a large sum!!!

<h2 id="CAGLIOSTRO_IN_LONDON">CAGLIOSTRO IN LONDON.</h2>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/c.jpg" alt="C" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Carlyle</span>, in a very diffuse essay on this
adventurer, thus introduces him: ‘The
Count Alessandro di Cagliostro, Pupil of
the sage Althotas, Foster-child of the
Scherif of Mecca, probable Son of the
last King of Trebisond; named also Acharat, and
unfortunate child of Nature; by profession healer of
diseases, abolisher of wrinkles, friend of the poor and
impotent, grand-master of the Egyptian Mason Lodge
of High Science, Spirit Summoner, Gold Cook, Grand
Cophta, Prophet, Priest, and thaumaturgic moralist
and swindler; really a Liar of the first magnitude,
thorough-paced in all provinces of Lying, what one
may call the King of Liars.</p>

<p>‘Mendez Pinto, Baron Muncha&uuml;sen, and others are
celebrated in this art, and not without some colour
of justice; yet must it in candour remain doubtful
whether any of these comparatively were much more
than liars from the teeth onwards: a perfect character
of the species in question, who lied not in word only,
but continually in thought, word, and act; and, so to
speak, lived wholly in an element of lying, and from
birth to death did nothing but lie&mdash;was still a desideratum.
Of which desideratum Count Alessandro
offers, we say, if not the fulfilment, perhaps as near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
an approach to it as the limited human faculties
permit.’</p>

<p>And yet this man made a name, and was famous
in his time, and even afterwards. Lives, novels, and
romances, notably being immortalized by Alexandre
Dumas in his ‘Memoires d’un M&eacute;decin,’ nay, even
plays, have been written about this clever rogue,
who rose from a poor man’s son to be the talk of
Europe, and his connection with the famous diamond
necklace, made him of almost political importance, sufficient
to warrant his incarceration in the Bastille.</p>

<p>I do not propose to write the life of Cagliostro&mdash;enough
and to spare has been written on this subject,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
but simply to treat of him in London; yet at
the same time it is necessary to say when and where
he was born&mdash;the more especially because he always
professed ignorance of his birth, and, when examined
in a French court of justice in relation to the famous
diamond necklace on January 30, 1786, the question
was put to him, ‘How old are you?’ <i>Answer</i>&mdash;‘Thirty-seven
or thirty-eight years.’ <i>Question</i>&mdash;‘Your
name?’ <i>Answer</i>&mdash;‘Alessandro Cagliostro.’
<i>Question</i>&mdash;‘Where born?’ <i>Answer</i>&mdash;‘I cannot say
for certain, whether it was at Malta or at Medina;
I have lived under the tuition of a governor, who
told me that I was of noble birth, that I was left an
orphan when only three months old,’ etc.</p>

<p>But in a French book,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> of which an English translation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
was made in 1786, Cagliostro is made to say, ‘I
cannot speak positively as to the place of my nativity,
nor to the parents who gave me birth. From various
circumstances of my life I have conceived some
doubts, in which the reader perhaps will join with
me. But I repeat it: all my inquiries have ended
only in giving me some great notions, it is true, but
altogether vague and uncertain concerning my
family.</p>

<p>‘I spent the years of my childhood in the city of
Medina, in Arabia. There I was brought up under
the name of Acharat, which I preserved during my
progress through Africa and Asia. I had apartments
in the palace of the Muphti Salahaym. It is needless
to add that the Muphti is the chief of the Mahometan
Religion, and that his constant residence is at Medina.</p>

<p>‘I recollect perfectly that I had then four persons
in my service; a governor, between 55 and 60 years
of age, whose name was Althotas, and three servants,
a white one, who attended me as valet-de-Chambre,
and two blacks, one of whom was constantly about
me night and day.</p>

<p>‘My Governor always told me that I had been left
an orphan when only three months old; that my
parents were Christians, and nobly born; but he left
me absolutely in the dark about their names, and the
place of my nativity: a few words which he dropped
by chance have induced me to suspect that I was
born at Malta; but this circumstance I have never
been able to ascertain.’</p>

<p>Althotas was a great sage, and imparted to his
young pupil all the scientific knowledge he possessed,
and that awful person, the Grand Muphti himself,
would deign to converse with the boy on the lore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
and history of ancient Egypt. At this time he says
he dressed as a Mussulman, and conformed to their
rites; but was all the time at heart a true Christian.</p>

<p>At the mature age of twelve, he felt a strong desire
to travel, and Althotas indulged him by joining a
caravan going to Mecca, and here comes an attempt
to fasten his paternity upon the Cherif of that place.</p>

<p>‘On our arrival at Mecca, we alighted at the palace
of the Cherif, who is the sovereign of Mecca, and of
all Arabia, and always chosen from amongst the
descendants of Mahomet. I here altered my dress,
from a simple one, which I had worn hitherto, to one
more splendid. On the third day after our arrival, I
was, by my Governor, presented to the Cherif, who
honoured me with the most endearing caresses. At
sight of this prince, my senses experienced a sudden
emotion, which it is not in the power of words to express;
my eyes dropped the most delicious tears I
ever shed in my life. His, I perceived, he could
hardly restrain....</p>

<p>‘I remained at Mecca for the space of three years;
not one day passed without my being admitted to
the Sovereign’s presence, and every hour increased
his attachment and added to my gratitude. I sometimes
surprized his eyes rivetted upon me, and then
looking up to heaven, with every expression of pity
and commiseration. Thoughtful, I would go from
him, a prey to an ever fruitless curiosity. I dared
not ask any question of my Governor, who always rebuked
me with great severity, as if it had been a
crime in me to wish for some information concerning
my parents, and the place where I was born....</p>

<p>‘One day as I was alone, the prince entered my
apartment; so great a favour struck me with amazement;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
he strained me to his bosom with more than
usual tenderness, bade me never cease to adore the
Almighty, telling me that, as long as I should persist
in serving God faithfully, I should at last be happy,
and come to the knowledge of my real destiny; then
he added, bedewing my cheeks with tears, “Adieu,
thou nature’s unfortunate child.” ...’</p>

<p>This is one side of the question&mdash;his own. It is
romantic, and in all probability a lie. There is another
side; but the evidence, although far more
within the bounds of reason, is unsupported by corroboration.
The authority is from an Italian book of
one hundred and eighty-nine pages, entitled: ‘Compendio
della Vita, et delle Gesta di <span class="smcap">Giuseppe Balsamo</span>,
denominato Il <span class="smcap">Conte Cagliostro</span>. <i>Che si &egrave; estratto
dal Processo contro di lui formato in Roma l’Anno, 1790.
E che pu&ograve; servire di scorta per conoscere l’indole della
Setta de</i> <span class="smcap">Liberi Muratori</span>.In Roma 1791.’ This
book purports to be printed in the Vatican, ‘from the
Printing press of the Reverend Apostolic Chamber.’<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>In the preface of this book is the following sentence,
which is intended to vouch for the facts it
contains: ‘Thence comes the justice of that observation,
that these Charlatans especially acquire credit,
renown, and riches, in those countries where the
least religion is found, where philosophy is most
fashionable. Rome is not a place that agrees with
them, because error cannot throw out its roots, in the
centre, the capital, of the true faith. The life of
Count Cagliostro is a shining proof of this truth. It is
for this reason that it has been thought proper to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
compose this compendium, faithfully extracted from
the proceedings taken against him, a short while
since, at Rome; this is evidence which the critic cannot
attack. In order to effect this, the Sovereign
Pontifical Authority has deigned to dispense with the
law of inviolable secrecy, which always accompanies,
with as much justice as prudence, the proceedings of
the Holy Inquisition.’</p>

<p>And the account of his life opens thus: ‘Joseph
Balsamo was born at Palermo on the 8th of June,
1743. His parents were Pietro Balsamo and Felice
Braconieri, both of mean extraction. His father, who
was a shopkeeper, dying when he was still a baby,
his maternal uncles took care of him,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>In another book, ‘The Life of the Count Cagliostro,’
&amp;c., London, 1787, there is a foot-note to the
first page: ‘Some authors are of opinion that he is
the offspring of the grand Master of Malta, by a
Turkish lady, made captive by a Maltese galley.
Others that he is the only surviving son of that
prince who, about thirty-five years ago, swayed the
precarious sceptre of Trebisond, at which period, a
revolution taking place, the reigning prince was
massacred by his seditious subjects, and his infant
son, the Count Cagliostro, conveyed by a trusty friend
to Medina, where the Cherif had the unprejudiced
generosity to have him educated in the faith of his
Christian parents.’</p>

<p>I do not follow his career, but the most marvellous
stories were current about him, <i>vide</i> the following
extract from a book already quoted (see foot-note
page 334): ‘The Comtesse de la Motte dares to assert
that one of my men makes a boast of having been
150 years in my service. That I sometimes acknowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
myself to be only 300 years old; at others that
I brag of having been present at the nuptials in Cana,
and that it was to burlesque the Holy Sacrament of
the Eucharist, the transubstantiation, that I had imagined
to multiply the necklace, taken to pieces, into
a hundred different manners, and yet it was delivered,
as it is said, in its full complement to the august
Queen.</p>

<p>‘That I am by turns a Portuguese Jew, a Greek,
an Egyptian of Alexandria, from whence I have imported
into France hyeroglyphics and sorcery.</p>

<p>‘That I am one of those infatuated Rosicrucians,
who have the power of making the dead converse
with the living; that I attend the poor gratis, but
that I sell for <i>something</i>, to the rich, the gifts of
immortality.’</p>

<p>But it is not of these things I wish to treat; it is
of the facts connected with his residence in London.
Two or three accounts say that he visited London in
1772, where he swindled a Doctor Benemore, who
had rescued him from prison, under pretence of painting
his country house, and his enemy, De Morande,
of the <i>Courier de l’Europe</i>, who, in No.’s 16, 17, and
18 of that journal, made frightful accusations against
Cagliostro, reiterates the story of his being here in
1772. In page xiv. of the preface to ‘The Life of
the Count Cagliostro,’ 1787, there occurs the following
passage: ‘M. de Morande is at infinite pains to
persuade us that the Count resided in London in
1772, under the name of Balsamo, in extreme poverty,
from which he was relieved by Sir Edward Hales.
That Baronet professes, indeed, to recollect an <i>Italian</i>
of that name; but, as M. de Morande positively
assures us that the Count is a <i>Calabrois</i>, a <i>Neapolitan</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
or a <i>Sicilian</i>, we can desire no better argument to
prove the fallacy of his information.’</p>

<p>In a pamphlet entitled, ‘Lettre du Comte Cagliostro
au Peuple Anglois pour servir de suite &agrave; ses
Memoires,’ 1786, p. 7, he says distinctly: ‘Nous
sommes arriv&eacute;s, ma femme et moi, en Angleterre, pour
la premi&egrave;re fois de ma vie, au mois de Juillet, 1776,’
and on p. 70 of the same work is the following
(translated):</p>

<p>‘The greatest part of the long diatribe of M.
Morande is used to prove that I came to London in
1772, under the name of <i>Balsamo</i>. In view of the
efforts which M. Morande makes, in order to arrive at
such proof, an attempt is made to show that the
<i>Balsamo</i> with whom they attempt to identify me
ought to have been hung, or, at all events, he rendered
himself guilty of some dishonourable actions.
Nothing of the sort. This <i>Balsamo</i>, if the <i>Courier de
l’Europe</i> can be believed, was a mediocre painter, who
lived by his brush. A man named <i>Benamore</i>, either
agent, or interpreter, or charg&eacute; d’affaires to the King
of Morocco, had commissioned him to paint some
pictures, and had not paid for them. <i>Balsamo</i> issued
a writ against him for &pound;47 sterling, which he said
was due to him, admitting that he had received two
guineas on account. Besides, this <i>Balsamo</i> was so
poor that his wife was obliged to go into town herself,
in order to sell the pictures which her husband
painted. Such is the portrait which M. de Morande
draws of the <i>Balsamo</i> of London, a portrait which no
one will accuse him of having flattered, and from
which the sensible reader will draw the conclusion
that the <i>Balsamo</i> of London was an honest artist who
gained a livelihood by hard work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>‘I might then admit without blushing that I had
lived in London in 1772 under the name of <i>Balsamo</i>,
on the product of my feeble talents in painting; that
the course of events and circumstances had reduced
me to this extremity, etc....</p>

<p>‘I am ignorant whether the law-suit between
<i>Balsamo</i> and <i>Benamore</i> is real or supposed: one thing
is certain, that in London exists a regular physician
of irreproachable probity, named Benamore. He is
versed in oriental languages: he was formerly attached,
as interpreter, to the Moroccan Embassy, and
he is, at this date, employed, in the same capacity,
by the ambassador of Tripoli. He will bear witness
to all who wish to know that, during the 30 years he
has been established in London, he has never known
another Benamore than himself, and that he has
never had a law-suit with anyone bearing the name
of <i>Balsamo</i>.’</p>

<p>Now take Carlyle, with whom dogmatism stood in
stead of research, and judge for yourselves. ‘There
is one briefest but authentic-looking glimpse of him
presents itself in England, in the year 1772: no Count
is he here, but mere Signor Balsamo again, engaged
in house-painting, for which he has a peculiar talent.
Was it true that he painted the country house of a
“Doctor Benemore;” and, not having painted, but
only smeared it, was refused payment, and got a
lawsuit with expenses instead? If Doctor Benemore
have left any representatives in the Earth, they are
desired to speak out. We add only, that if young
Beppo had one of the prettiest of wives, old Benemore
had one of the ugliest daughters; and so, putting
one thing to another, matters might not be so
bad.’

<p>Who set this story afloat, about Cagliostro being in
London in 1772? Why, Monsieur de Morande, the
editor of the <i>Courier de l’Europe</i>, and of his veracity
we may judge by an advertisement in the <i>London
Evening Post</i> of November 27 to 30, 1773, p. 4, col. 4,
(translated).</p>

<p>‘Monsieur Le Comte de Lauraguais has kindly
consented, after the humble apologies I have made
to him, to forego the action commenced against me
for having defamed him in some verses full of untruths,
injurious both to his honour and his reputation,
of which I was the author, and which I caused to be
inserted in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of 24 and 25 June
last, entitled: “Answer of the Gazetteer Cuirass&eacute;.”
I therefore beg you, Mr. Woodfall,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> to publish through
the same channel by which I made my verses public,&mdash;my
sincere repentance for having so injuriously
libelled Monsieur le Comte, and my very humble
thanks for his having accepted my apologies, and
stopping all action in the matter.</p>

<p class="author">‘<span class="smcap">De Morande.</span></p>

<p>‘Nov. 26, 1773.’</p>

<p>This is what in law would be called <i>a tainted witness</i>,
as, about that time he was, on his own confession,
given to lying.</p>

<p>According to his own account he came to London
in July, 1776, possessed of a capital of about three
thousand pounds in plate, jewels, and specie, and
hired apartments in Whitcomb Street, Pall Mall East,
and here he fell into evil company. The story is not
very lucid&mdash;but it seems that his wife’s companion,
a Portuguese woman named Blavary, and his secretary
and interpreter, Vitellini, introduced to him a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Lord Scot. They were a lot of sharpers all round.
Scot introduced a woman as his wife&mdash;Lady Scot,
if you please&mdash;(in reality Miss Fry), who got money
and clothes from the countess, and Cagliostro lent
my lord two hundred pounds on his simple note of
hand.</p>

<p>He declares that he gave them lucky numbers for
the lottery, and that they gained much money thereby&mdash;on
one occasion, when he gave Miss Fry the
number eight, she won the sum of fifteen hundred
guineas; but she was requested by Cagliostro not to
visit, or bother himself, or his wife again. He moved
into Suffolk Street in January, 1777, but the persevering
Miss Fry took lodgings in the same house.
She attempted to borrow money, and to get lucky
numbers, but, failing in both, she had him arrested on
the 7th of February for a pretended debt of one hundred
and ninety pounds. He recovered his liberty
the next day, by depositing in the hands of the
sheriff’s officer, jewels worth double the amount.</p>

<p>Then a warrant was taken out against him and his
wife, signed by one Justice Miller&mdash;on the charge of
practising witchcraft. This does not, however, seem
to have been acted on, but he was frequently harassed
by actions for debt brought against him by Miss
Fry, and he became well acquainted with the inside
of a spunging-house. On the 24th of May he was
taken into custody for a debt of two hundred pounds,
at the suit of Miss Fry, but he managed to find bail.
The case was tried before Lord Mansfield, in the
Court of Queen’s Bench, on the 27th of June, but
his lordship suggested that it was a case for arbitration,
which was agreed to.</p>

<p>The arbitration took place on the 4th of July, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
Cagliostro’s lawyer deserted him, and the decision
was that the count had lost his case, and must pay all
costs. As if this was not bad enough, as he was
leaving the court he was arrested at the suit of one
Aylett, who had lodged a detainer against him for a
debt of ten pounds and upwards, by the name of
Melisa Cagliostro, otherwise Joseph Balsamo, which
debt he said was due to him from Balsamo, who had
employed him in 1772 to recover a debt from Dr.
Benamore. He got bail, but, as his money was getting
scarce, it was at the cost of ‘two soup-ladles, two
candlesticks, two salt-cellars, two pepper-castors, six
forks, six table spoons, nine knife handles with blades,
a pair of snuffers and stand, all of silver.’ He had,
however, suffered six weeks’ imprisonment, as he was
not liberated from the King’s Bench till the 24th of
September, 1777.</p>

<p>In vain his friends endeavoured to stir him up to
commence actions for fraud and perjury against all
concerned, but either his cause was not just, or he
had had enough law to last him some time&mdash;and he
refused. He paid up his debts and left England, with
only fifty guineas and a few jewels in his possession.</p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, he was connected with the
‘Diamond Necklace’ affair, and suffered incarceration
in the Bastile. If he can be at all believed, the police
plundered him and his wife right royally. He says
he lost fifteen rouleaux, each containing fifty double
louis, sealed with his seal; one thousand two hundred
and thirty-three sequins (Venetian and Roman): one
rouleau of twenty-four Spanish quadruples, sealed
also; and forty-seven billets of one thousand livres
each on the Caisse d’Escompte. They also took
papers which were to him of inestimable value; and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
as to diamonds and jewellery, he knew not what was
taken, besides plate, porcelain, and linen, etc. After
an examination, he was acquitted, but he had to leave
France, and came to London, where he lived in
Sloane Street. Here he became acquainted with
Lord George Gordon, and this acquaintance afterwards
cost him dearly, when he was arrested at Rome.
To show the intimacy between the two, I will quote
from the <i>Public Advertiser</i> of the 22nd of August,
1786, p. 2, col. 3.</p>

<p>‘M. Barthelemy, who conducts the affairs of France
in the absence of Comte Dazimer, having sent M.
Daragon with a message to Comte de Cagliostro,
in Sloane Street, intimating that he had received
orders from the Court of Versailles to communicate
to Comte de Cagliostro that he now had permission
to return to France; yesterday morning, the Comte,
accompanied by Lord George Gordon and M. Bergeret
de Frouville, waited upon M. Barthelemy at
the “Hotel of France,” in Piccadilly, for an eclaireissement
upon the subject of this message from
the Court of France, delivered by M. Barthelemy,
relative to the permission granted to the Comte de
Cagliostro to return to Paris. M. Barthelemy, the
Comte de Cambise, and M. Daragon seemed much
surprised to see Comte de Cagliostro arrive in Lord
George Gordon’s coach, with his Lordship, and M.
Frouville, and, having expressed their desire that
the Comte de Cagliostro <i>alone</i> should speak with M.
Barthelemy, they were informed that Lord Gordon
and M. Bergeret de Frouville were there on purpose
to attend their friend, and that Comte de Cagliostro
would not dispense with Lord George Gordon’s absence
from the Conference. Will any friend to liberty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
blame Comte de Cagliostro, after ten months’ imprisonment
in a dungeon, for having his friends near
him, when insidious proposals are made to him by
the faction of Breteuil and the supporters of the
Bastile Men who have already sought his destruction,
and, after his innocence was declared by the
judgment of the Parliament of Paris, embezzled a
great part of his fortune, and exiled him from France?
M. Barthelemy (seeing the determination of the
Comte’s friends) then read the letter from M. Breteuil;
but, upon the Comte de Cagliostro desiring
a copy, M. Barthelemy refused it. A great deal of
conversation then ensued upon the subject, which
in all probability will give rise to a full representation
to the King of France, who is certainly very
much imposed on. The Queen’s party is still violent
against Comte de Cagliostro, the friend of mankind;
and De Breteuil&mdash;le Sieur De Launey&mdash;Titon&mdash;De
Bruni&egrave;res&mdash;Ma&icirc;tre Chesnon&mdash;Barthelemy and Dazimer
are mere instruments of that faction. The honour
of the King of France, the justice and judgment
of the Parliament of Paris, the good faith of the
Citizens, and the good name of the nation, are all
attainted by the pillage and detention of the property
of Comte de Cagliostro.’</p>

<p>And again, in the same paper, 24th of August, 1786,
p. 2, col. 3, is another paragraph respecting him:</p>

<p>‘Comte de Cagliostro has declared he will hold no
intercourse with any of Le Sieur Breteuil’s messengers
from France, except in the presence of Lord
George Gordon. The gang of French spies in London,
who are linked in with M. de Morande, and
the Sieurs Barthelemy, Dazimer, Cambise, and the
Queen’s Bastile party at Paris, are trying the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
insiduous arts to entrap the Comte and Comtesse,
and have the effrontery and audaciousness to persecute
them publicly, and vilify them even in this free
country, where these noble Strangers are come to
seek protection in the arms of a generous people.
The friendship and benevolence of Comte de Cagliostro,
in advising the poor Prince Louis de Rohan to
be upon his guard against the Comtesse de Valois,
and the intrigues of the Queen’s faction, (who still
seek the destruction of that noble Prince) has brought
upon the Comte and his amiable Comtesse the hateful
revenge of a tyrannical Government. The
story of the Diamonds has never been properly
explained to the Public in France. It would discover
too much of the base arts practised to destroy
Prince Louis, and involve in guilt persons not safe
to name in an arbitrary kingdom.’</p>

<p>This airing of private grief in public extorted some
strictures in a letter in the <i>Morning Post</i>, of 29th
of August, 1786, in which it was suggested, generally,
that foreigners should wash their dirty linen at
home. But Monsieur de Morande, editor of the
<i>Courier de l’Europe</i>, published many assertions, be
they facts, or fiction, relative to Cagliostro, and he
once more blossomed out into print in his old
champion, the <i>Public Advertiser</i> (vide that newspaper,
5th of September, 1786, p. 2. col. 1), translated
in the number of 7th September. In this curious
letter, he adverts to his adversaries’ slanders, and the
following singular passages occur:</p>

<p>‘Of all the very good stories which you relate at
my expense, the best, without comparison, is that of
the pig fed with arsenic, which poisoned the lions,
tygers, and leopards of the forests of Medina. I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
going, Mr. Railer, to give you an opportunity of
being witty on a perfect comprehension of the fact.
You know that, in physics and chymistry, reasoning
proves but little, ridicule nothing, and that experiment
is all. Permit me, then, to propose a small
experiment to you, of which the issue will divert the
public, either at your expense, or mine. I invite you
to breakfast with me on the 9th of November next,
at nine o’clock in the morning. You shall furnish
the wine, and the appendages. For myself, I shall only
furnish a single dish, after my own fashion&mdash;it shall
be a sucking pig, fattened after my method. Two
hours before breakfast, I shall present you the pig
alive, fat and healthy. You shall order it to be
killed as you please, and prepared, and I shall not
approach until it is served at the table. You shall
cut it into four equal parts, you shall chuse that which
most flatters your appetite, and I shall take that
which you please. The day after that of our breakfast,
one or more of four things will happen. Either
both of us shall die, or we neither of us shall die,
or you shall die and I survive, or I shall die and you
survive. Of these four chances I give you three,
and I bet you 5000 guineas, that, on the day after
our breakfast, you shall die, and I be perfectly well.
You must either accept of this Challenge, or acknowledge
that you are an ignorant fellow, and that you
have foolishly ridiculed a thing which is totally out
of your knowledge.</p>

<p>‘If you accept of this Challenge, I shall instantly
deposit the 5000 guineas with any banker that you
please. You shall do the same in five days, during
which time you shall have leave to make your supporters
Contribute,’ &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

<p>Monsieur de Morande’s reply was published immediately
following the above letter. It is, like
Cagliostro’s, too long for insertion; but its gist is,
that he intends to unmask the pretender, and that he
utterly declines to attend a poisoning match. He
writes:</p>

<p>‘I solemnly defy you to contradict them’ (<i>i.e.</i>, his
assertions as to Cagliostro’s quackeries and adventures);
‘and that I even offer, without croupiers or
supporters, to make you another wager of five thousand
guineas that I shall compleatly unmask you.</p>

<p>‘But, <i>Monsieur le Comte</i>, I shall not put my foot in
your house, and shall not breakfast with you myself.
I am neither abject enough to keep you company, nor
will let it be suspected for a single moment.</p>

<p>‘You clearly conceive that such an interview ought
not, nor can be, within your doors; you would be
liable to be found guilty of criminal practises, in case
of accident. This your <i>Council</i> had not foreseen.</p>

<p>‘As no tavern would permit such infamous scenes
to pass under its roof as those you propose, you must,
<i>Monsieur le Comte</i>, return once more to the <i>booth</i>;
and worthy disciple of <span class="smcap">Locusta</span>,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> choose in London
a public place to make an open-air exhibition of your
talents.’</p>

<p>And like the scorpion, which carries its sting in its
tail, he adds a foot-note, which refers to the heading
of his letter:</p>

<p>‘<i>M. de Morande’s Answer to Don Joseph Balsamo,</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
<i>self-created Count of Cagliostro, Colonel in the Service
of all the Sovereign Powers in Europe.</i>’</p>

<p>‘If it was not the case, it would be very singular
to have seen, in the year 1777, M. Cagliostro calling
himself in England Colonel of the Third Regiment of
Brandenbourg, and, afterwards, in Russia, Colonel in
the Spanish Service; for which, however, he was reprimanded
by the magistrates of Petersburgh. Having
forgot to take his Commission with him, he could not
exhibit proofs, and was obliged to put down his regimentals.
This check on his conduct made him
abscond from Petersburgh. Every Russian nobleman
in London knows this anecdote, and, without presuming
to mention names, we trust that this will be found
to be the case upon enquiry.’</p>

<p>To this letter Cagliostro replied with another in the
<i>Public Advertiser</i> (p. 2, col. 1) of September 9, 1786,
in which he repeats his challenge, and declines to sit
down to breakfast with a carnivorous animal.</p>

<p>De Morande, of course, could not be silent, and
replied in the <i>Public Advertiser</i> (p. 2, col. 1) of
September 12, 1786. He reiterated the charges he
made against Cagliostro in the <i>Courier de l’Europe</i>,
saying, among other things, ‘I have said that you
were in England in the year 1771, under the name of
<i>Balsamo</i>, and that you were then a needy, as well as
a <i>very indifferent</i> painter; that twenty persons, at
least, are ready to prove it. You take no notice of
this second assertion, which becomes serious, <i>by the
oath you have taken under that name</i>, of which I have a
legal copy in my possession.</p>

<p>‘I have said that you have made your appearance
under another name, <span class="smcap">that of Cagliostro</span>, in the
year 1777. I have several <i>affidavits</i>, amongst which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
there are some of your own, which authenticate very
curious anecdotes concerning you; to this you have
replied nothing.</p>

<p>‘I have said that you falsely pretended then to be a
<i>Colonel of the third regiment</i> of Brandenbourg; that
you had, at that time, a law-suit in the Court of
Queen’s Bench, <i>about a certain necklace, and a gold
snuff-box</i>, which you asserted to have been given
<span class="smcap">Madame la Comtesse</span>, but which you were obliged to
return, and pay all Costs, on the Clear proofs given
by your adverse party, that you obtained them <i>under
false pretences</i>. No reply has been made to this.</p>

<p>‘I have added that, were you curious to try the
same experiment now, a new Act of Parliament, which
you and your fellow-adventurers have rendered <i>very
necessary</i>, would certainly have caused you to be sent
to the Thames.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> To that direct and very clear
observation you have not replied a single word.</p>

<p>‘I have said that you were ordered by the Police in
Russia, not to presume to take the name of a Colonel
in the Spanish service, and to strip off your Spanish
regimentals. I have given you an opportunity to
vindicate yourself, by giving to understand, that
there is not a Russian nobleman in London who
would not certify this fact. I might have added that
I have in my possession <i>the most respectable authority</i>
to say so. What have you said in reply to this?</p>

<p>‘I have roundly asserted that I am in possession of
proofs, that you are an impostor under every possible
denomination; that you have not only no pretension
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
to any title, but not even to the rank of a sergeant.
Shall this remain likewise unanswered?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘I am sorry to be obliged once more to name
Mess<sup>rs.</sup> B. &amp; C. Bankers, to prove that your pretensions
to lay a wager of 5000 guineas, are as well
grounded as your pretensions to the title of a <span class="smcap">Count</span>,
or an <i>Alchemist</i>. It is a fact, that you <i>humbly</i> offered
to pledge in their hands the watch, of which the too
long, and too much, deluded Cardinal de Rohan made
you a present. It is likewise a fact <i>that they disdainfully
refused it</i>. Your proposing, after this, a wager
of 5000 guineas is probably no more than a new pretence
to obtain credit, as you have formerly (in
pretending to make great quantities of gold) obtained
small sums, and little diamonds to make larger,
which you afterwards declared had been given to
<span class="smcap">Madame la Comtesse</span>. Those proofs, I repeat to you,
<i>are in my possession</i>; they are all fully authenticated,
and I will make good every one of my assertions.’
And he winds up his letter with expressing ‘the satisfaction
I feel in having furnished the world with
sufficient proofs to convince them that you are
<span class="smcap">THE GREATEST IMPOSTOR OF THIS OR ANY OTHER AGE</span>.’</p>

<p>This ended the correspondence, for the general
public were beginning to meddle in it, and the editor
of the <i>Public Advertiser</i> would only open his pages
to the principals in this duel. This finished Cagliostro’s
career in England. He had tried to sell his
quack medicines, his Egyptian pills, but the charm
was broken, and he quitted England for the Continent
in May, 1787, leaving his wife behind, with
sufficient means, under the guardianship of the De
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Loutherbourgs. She afterwards sold all up, and
joined him in June.</p>

<p>By this time his good genius had forsaken him, and
for teaching freemasonry, then even more repugnant
to the Roman Catholic hierarchy than at present, he
was arrested, and imprisoned in the Castle of St.
Angelo, November 27, 1789. He never again enjoyed
freedom, but was found dead in his cell at St. Leo.
Even the date of his death is uncertain, most authorities
giving 1795; but some say 1794 and 1797. His
wife, too, shared his fate; she was convicted of
sorcery and witchcraft, and was shut up in a convent,
where she died in 1794.</p>

<p>His portraits represent him as by no means bad-looking,
although the full eye, the puffed cheeks, and
weak mouth betray a sensuality of feeling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lodge’s Peerage and Baronetage</span> is acknowledged to be the most
complete, as well as the most elegant, work of the kind. As an established

histories, honours, and connections of the titled aristocracy, no work has
ever stood so high. It is published under the especial patronage of Her
Majesty, and is annually corrected throughout, from the personal communications
of the Nobility. It is the only work of its class in which, <i>the
type being kept constantly standing</i>, every correction is made in its proper
place to the date of publication, an advantage which gives it supremacy
over all its competitors. Independently of its full and authentic information
respecting the existing Peers and Baronets of the realm, the most
sedulous attention is given in its pages to the collateral branches of the
various noble families, and the names of many thousand individuals are
introduced, which do not appear in other records of the titled classes. For
its authority, correctness, and facility of arrangement, and the beauty of
its typography and binding, the work is justly entitled to the place it
occupies on the tables of Her Majesty and the Nobility.</p>

<h3><span class="gesperrt">DONOVAN:</span><br />

<span class="medium">A MODERN ENGLISHMAN.</span></h3>

<p>“This is a very admirable work. The reader is from the first carried away by the
gallant unconventionality of its author. ‘Donovan’ is a very excellent novel; but it is
something more and better. It should do as much good as the best sermon ever written
or delivered extempore. The story is told with a grand simplicity, an unconscious poetry
of eloquence which stirs the very depths of the heart. One of the main excellencies of
this novel is the delicacy of touch with which the author shows her most delightful characters
to be after all human beings, and not angels before their time.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>“‘Donovan’ is told with the power of truth, experience, and moral insight. The tone
of the novel is excellent and very high.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3 class="gesperrt">WE TWO.</h3>

<p>“This book is well written and full of interest. The story abounds with a good many
light touches, and is certainly far from lacking in incident.”&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>“‘We Two’ contains many very exciting passages and a great deal of information.
Miss Lyall is a capable writer and a clear-headed thinker.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“A work of deep thought and much power. Serious as it is, it is now and then brightened
by rays of genuine humour. Altogether this story is more and better than a novel.”&mdash;<i>Morning
Post.</i></p>

<p>“There is artistic realism both in the conception and the delineation of the personages;
the action and interest are unflaggingly sustained from first to last, and the book is pervaded
by an atmosphere of elevated, earnest thought.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3 class="gesperrt">IN THE GOLDEN DAYS.</h3>

<p>“Miss Lyall has given us a vigorous study of such life and character as are really worth
reading about. The central figure of her story is Algernon Sydney; and this figure she
invests with a singular dignity and power. He always appears with effect, but no liberties
are taken with the facts of his life. The plot is adapted with great felicity to them.
His part in it, absolutely consistent as it is with historical truth, gives it reality as well as
dignity. Some of the scenes are remarkably vivid. The escape is an admirable narrative,
which almost makes one hold one’s breath as one reads.”&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“‘In the Golden Days’ is an excellent novel of a kind we are always particularly glad
to recommend. It has a good foundation of plot and incident, a thoroughly noble and
wholesome motive, a hero who really acts and suffers heroically, and two very nice
heroines. The historical background is very carefully indicated, but is never allowed to
become more than background.”&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3 class="gesperrt">WON BY WAITING.</h3>

<p>“The Dean’s daughters are perfectly real characters&mdash;the learned Cornelia especially;&mdash;the
little impulsive French heroine, who endures their cold hospitality and at last wins
their affection, is thoroughly charming; while throughout the book there runs a golden
thread of pure brotherly and sisterly love, which pleasantly reminds us that the making
and marring of marriage is not, after all, the sum total of real life.”&mdash;<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>“‘Won by Waiting’ is a very pleasing and well-written tale; full of graphic descriptions
of French and English life, with incidents and characters well sustained. A book
with such pleasant reading, and with such a healthy tone and influence, is a great boon
to the young people in our families.”&mdash;<i>Freeman.</i>

<span class="medium">By the Right Hon. <span class="smcap">A. J. B. Beresford Hope</span>, M.P.</span></h3>

<p>“The great attraction of this novel is the easy, conversational, knowledgeable tone of
it; the sketching from the life, and yet not so close to the life as to be malicious, men,
women, periods, and events, to all of which intelligent readers can fit a name. The
political and social sketches will naturally excite the chief interest among readers who
will be attracted by the author’s name and experience.”&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i>

<h3>I.&mdash;SAM SLICK’S NATURE AND HUMAN NATURE.</h3>

<p>“The first volume of Messrs. Hurst and Blackett’s Standard Library of Cheap Editions
forms a very good beginning to what will doubtless be a very successful undertaking.
‘Nature and Human Nature’ is one of the best of Sam Slick’s witty and humorous productions,
and well entitled to the large circulation which it cannot fail to obtain in its
present convenient and cheap shape. The volume combines with the great recommendations
of a clear, bold type and good paper, the lesser, but attractive merits of being well
illustrated and elegantly bound.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>II.&mdash;JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.</h3>

<p>“The new and cheaper edition of this interesting work will doubtless meet with great
success. John Halifax, the hero of this most beautiful story, is no ordinary hero, and
this his history is no ordinary book. It is a full-length portrait of a true gentleman, one
of nature’s own nobility. It is also the history of a home, and a thoroughly English one.
The work abounds in incident, and many of the scenes are full of graphic power and true
pathos. It is a book that few will read without becoming wiser and better.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“This story is very interesting. The attachment between John Halifax and his wife is
beautifully painted, as are the pictures of their domestic life, and the growing up of their
children; and the conclusion of the book is beautiful and touching.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>III.&mdash;THE CRESCENT AND THE CROSS.<br />

<span class="medium">BY ELIOT WARBURTON.</span></h3>

<p>“Independent of its value as an original narrative, and its useful and interesting
information, this work is remarkable for the colouring power and play of fancy with
which its descriptions are enlivened. Among its greatest and most lasting charms is its
reverent and serious spirit.”&mdash;<i>Quarterly Review.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Warburton has fulfilled the promise of his title-page. The ‘Realities of Eastern
Travel’ are described with a vividness which invests them with deep and abiding interest;
while the ‘Romantic’ adventures which the enterprising tourist met with in his
course are narrated with a spirit which shows how much he enjoyed these reliefs from
the ennui of every-day life.”&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>IV.&mdash;NATHALIE.<br />

<span class="medium">BY JULIA KAVANAGH.</span></h3>

<p>“‘Nathalie’ is Miss Kavanagh’s best imaginative effort. Its manner is gracious and
attractive. Its matter is good. A sentiment, a tenderness, are commanded by her which
are as individual as they are elegant. We should not soon come to an end were we to
specify all the delicate touches and attractive pictures which place ‘Nathalie’ high among
books of its class.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>V.&mdash;A WOMAN’S THOUGHTS ABOUT WOMEN.<br />

<span class="medium">BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</span></h3>

<p>“These thoughts are good and humane. They are thoughts we would wish women to
think: they are much more to the purpose than the treatises upon the women and daughters
of England, which were fashionable some years ago, and these thoughts mark the
progress of opinion, and indicate a higher tone of character, and a juster estimate of
woman’s position.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“This excellent book is characterised by good sense, good taste, and feeling, and is
written in an earnest, philanthropic, as well as practical spirit.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>VI.&mdash;ADAM GRAEME OF MOSSGRAY.<br />

<span class="medium">BY MRS. OLIPHANT.</span></h3>

<p>“‘Adam Graeme’ is a story awakening genuine emotions of interest and delight by its
admirable pictures of Scottish life and scenery. The plot is cleverly complicated, and
there is great vitality in the dialogue, and remarkable brilliancy in the descriptive passages,
as who that has read ‘Margaret Maitland’ would not be prepared to expect?
But the story has a ‘mightier magnet still,’ in the healthy tone which pervades it, in its
feminine delicacy of thought and diction, and in the truly womanly tenderness of its
sentiments. The eloquent author sets before us the essential attributes of Christian
virtue, their deep and silent workings in the heart, and their beautiful manifestations in
the life, with a delicacy, a power, and a truth which can hardly be surpassed.”&mdash;<i>Morning
Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>VII.&mdash;SAM SLICK’S WISE SAWS AND MODERN INSTANCES.</h3>

<p>“We have not the slightest intention to criticise this book. Its reputation is made, and
will stand as long as that of Scott’s or Bulwer’s novels. The remarkable originality of
its purpose, and the happy description it affords of American life and manners, still continue
the subject of universal admiration. To say thus much is to say enough, though we
must just mention that the new edition forms a part of the Publishers’ Cheap Standard
Library, which has included some of the very best specimens of light literature that ever
have been written.”&mdash;<i>Messenger.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>VIII.&mdash;CARDINAL WISEMAN’S RECOLLECTIONS
OF THE LAST FOUR POPES.</h3>

<p>“A picturesque book on Rome and its ecclesiastical sovereigns, by an eloquent Roman
Catholic. Cardinal Wiseman has here treated a special subject with so much generality
and geniality that his recollections will excite no ill-feeling in those who are most conscientiously
opposed to every idea of human infallibility represented in Papal domination.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>IX.&mdash;A LIFE FOR A LIFE.<br />

<span class="medium">BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</span></h3>

<p>“We are always glad to welcome Mrs. Craik. She writes from her own convictions,
and she has the power not only to conceive clearly what it is that she wishes to
say, but to express it in language effective and vigorous. In ‘A Life for a Life’ she is
fortunate in a good subject, and she has produced a work of strong effect. The
reader, having read the book through for the story, will be apt (if he be of our persuasion)
to return and read again many pages and passages with greater pleasure
than on a first perusal. The whole book is replete with a graceful, tender delicacy;
and, in addition to its other merits, it is written in good careful English.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“‘A Life for a Life’ is a book of a high class. The characters are depicted with a
masterly hand; the events are dramatically set forth; the descriptions of scenery and
sketches of society are admirably penned; moreover, the work has an object&mdash;a clearly
defined moral&mdash;most poetically, most beautifully drawn, and through all there is that
strong, reflective mind visible which lays bare the human heart and human mind to the
very core.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>X.&mdash;THE OLD COURT SUBURB.<br />

<span class="medium">BY LEIGH HUNT.</span></h3>

<p>“A book which has afforded us no slight gratification.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“From the mixture of description, anecdote, biography, and criticism, this book is very
pleasant reading.”&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“A more agreeable and entertaining book has not been published since Boswell produced
his reminiscences of Johnson.”&mdash;<i>Observer.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XI.&mdash;MARGARET AND HER BRIDESMAIDS.<br />

<span class="medium">BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE VALLEY OF A HUNDRED FIRES.”</span></h3>

<p>“We recommend all who are in search of a fascinating novel to read this work for
themselves. They will find it well worth their while. There are a freshness and originality
about it quite charming, and there is a certain nobleness in the treatment both of
sentiment and incident which is not often found.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XII.&mdash;THE OLD JUDGE; OR, LIFE IN A COLONY.<br />

<span class="medium">BY SAM SLICK.</span></h3>

<p>“A peculiar interest attaches to sketches of colonial life, and readers could not have a
safer guide than the talented author of this work, who, by a residence of half a century,
has practically grasped the habits, manners, and social conditions of the colonists he describes.
All who wish to form a fair idea of the difficulties and pleasures of life in a new
country, unlike England in some respects, yet like it in many, should read this book.”&mdash;
<i>John Bull.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XIII.&mdash;DARIEN; OR, THE MERCHANT PRINCE.<br />

<span class="medium">BY ELIOT WARBURTON.</span></h3>

<p>“This last production of the author of ‘The Crescent and the Cross’ has the same
elements of a very wide popularity. It will please its thousands.”&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p>“Eliot Warburton’s active and productive genius is amply exemplified in the present
book. We have seldom met with any work in which the realities of history and the
poetry of fiction were more happily interwoven.”&mdash;<i>Illustrated News.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XIV.&mdash;FAMILY ROMANCE; OR, DOMESTIC ANNALS
OF THE ARISTOCRACY.<br />

<span class="medium">BY SIR BERNARD BURKE, ULSTER KING OF ARMS.</span></h3>

<p>“It were impossible to praise too highly this most interesting book, whether we should
have regard to its excellent plan or its not less excellent execution. It ought to be found
on every drawing-room table. Here you have nearly fifty captivating romances with the
pith of all their interest preserved in undiminished poignancy, and any one may be read
in half an hour. It is not the least of their merits that the romances are founded on fact&mdash;or
what, at least, has been handed down for truth by long tradition&mdash;and the romance
of reality far exceeds the romance of fiction.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XV.&mdash;THE LAIRD OF NORLAW.<br />

<span class="medium">BY MRS. OLIPHANT.</span></h3>

<p>“We have had frequent opportunities of commending Messrs. Hurst and Blackett’s
Standard Library. For neatness, elegance, and distinctness the volumes in this series
surpass anything with which we are familiar. ‘The Laird of Norlaw’ will fully sustain
the author’s high reputation. The reader is carried on from first to last with an energy
of sympathy that never flags.”&mdash;<i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>“‘The Laird of Norlaw’ is worthy of the author’s reputation. It is one of the most
exquisite of modern novels.”&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XVI.&mdash;THE ENGLISHWOMAN IN ITALY.<br />

<span class="medium">BY MRS. G. GRETTON.</span></h3>

<p>“Mrs. Gretton had opportunities which rarely fall to the lot of strangers of becoming
acquainted with the inner life and habits of a part of the Italian peninsula which is the
very centre of the national crisis. We can praise her performance as interesting, unexaggerated,
and full of opportune instruction.”&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>“Mrs. Gretton’s book is timely, life-like, and for every reason to be recommended. It
is impossible to close the book without liking the writer as well as the subject. The work
is engaging, because real.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XVII.&mdash;NOTHING NEW.<br />

<span class="medium">BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</span></h3>

<p>“‘Nothing New’ displays all those superior merits which have made ‘John Halifax’
one of the most popular works of the day. There is a force and truthfulness about these
tales which mark them as the production of no ordinary mind, and we cordially recommend
them to the perusal of all lovers of fiction.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XVIII.&mdash;LIFE OF JEANNE D’ALBRET, QUEEN OF
NAVARRE.<br />

<span class="medium">BY MISS FREER.</span></h3>

<p>“We have read this book with great pleasure, and have no hesitation in recommending
it to general perusal. It reflects the highest credit on the industry and ability of Miss
Freer. Nothing can be more interesting than her story of the life of Jeanne D’Albret,
and the narrative is as trustworthy as it is attractive.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XIX.&mdash;THE VALLEY OF A HUNDRED FIRES.<br />

<span class="medium">BY THE AUTHOR OF “MARGARET AND HER BRIDESMAIDS.”</span></h3>

<p>“If asked to classify this work, we should give it a place between ‘John Halifax’ and
‘The Caxtons.’”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>“The spirit in which the whole book is written is refined and good.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“This is in every sense a charming novel.”&mdash;<i>Messenger.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XX.&mdash;THE ROMANCE OF THE FORUM; OR, NARRATIVES,
SCENES, AND ANECDOTES FROM COURTS OF JUSTICE.<br />

<span class="medium">BY JULIA KAVANAGH.</span></h3>

to the close.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“‘Ad&egrave;le’ will fully sustain the reputation of Miss Kavanagh, high as it already ranks.”&mdash;<i>John
Bull.</i></p>

novel.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>XXII.&mdash;STUDIES FROM LIFE.<br />

<span class="medium">BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</span></h3>

<p>“These ‘Studies’ are truthful and vivid pictures of life, often earnest, always full of right
feeling, and occasionally lightened by touches of quiet, genial humour. The volume is remarkable
for thought, sound sense, shrewd observation, and kind and sympathetic feeling
for all things good and beautiful.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>“These ‘Studies from Life’ are remarkable for graphic power and observation. The
book will not diminish the reputation of the accomplished author.”&mdash;<i>Saturday Review.</i>

the circulating library.”&mdash;<i>Lancet.</i></p>

<p>“This is a pleasant book for the fireside season, and for the seaside season. Mr. Jeaffreson
has, out of hundreds of volumes, collected thousands of good things, adding thereto
much that appears in print for the first time, and which, of course, gives increased value
to this very readable book.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“‘St Olave’s’ belongs to a lofty order of fiction. It is a good novel, but it is something

the work from the first page to the last.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“A novel of uncommon merit. Sir Walter Scott said he would advise no man to try

<h3>XLV.&mdash;THE UNKIND WORD.<br />

<span class="medium">BY THE AUTHOR OF “JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.”</span></h3>

<p>“These stories are gems of narrative. Indeed, some of them, in their touching grace
and simplicity, seem to us to possess a charm even beyond the authoress’s most popular
novels. Of none of them can this be said more emphatically than of that which opens the
series, ‘The Unkind Word.’ It is wonderful to see the imaginative power displayed in
the few delicate touches by which this successful love-story is sketched out.”&mdash;<i>The Echo.</i>

<h3>LII.&mdash;LORD BRACKENBURY.<br />

<span class="medium">BY AMELIA B. EDWARDS.</span></h3>

variety, cheerful dialogue, and general ‘verve’ in the book.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<h3>NATURE AND HUMAN NATURE.</h3>

<p>“We enjoy our old friend’s company with unabated relish. This work is a rattling
miscellany of sharp sayings, stories, and hard hits. It is full of fun and fancy.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“Since Sam’s first work he has written nothing so fresh, racy, and genuinely humorous as
this. Every line of it tells in some way or other&mdash;instructively, satirically, jocosely, or
wittily. Admiration of Sam’s mature talents, and laughter at his droll yarns, constantly
alternate as with unhalting avidity we peruse the work. The Clockmaker proves himself
the fastest time-killer a-going.”&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p>

<h3>WISE SAWS AND MODERN INSTANCES.</h3>

<p>“This delightful book will be the most popular, as beyond doubt it is the best, of all the
author’s admirable works.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>“The book before us will be read and laughed over. Its quaint and racy dialect will
please some readers&mdash;its abundance of yarns will amuse others. There is something to
suit readers of every humour.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“The humour of Sam Slick is inexhaustible. He is ever and everywhere a welcome
visitor; smiles greet his approach, and wit and wisdom hang upon his tongue. We promise
our readers a great treat from the perusal of these ‘Wise Saws,’ which contain a
world of practical wisdom, and a treasury of the richest fun.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE OLD JUDGE; OR, LIFE IN A COLONY.</h3>

<p>“By common consent this work is regarded as one of the raciest, truest to life, most
humorous, and most interesting works which have proceeded from the prolific pen of its
author. We all know what shrewdness of observation, what power of graphic description,
what natural resources of drollery, and what a happy method of hitting off the
broader characteristics of the life he reviews, belong to Judge Haliburton. We have all
those qualities here; but they are balanced by a serious literary purpose, and are employed
in the communication of information respecting certain phases of colonial experience
which impart to the work an element of sober utility.”&mdash;<i>Sunday Times.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>TRAITS OF AMERICAN HUMOUR.</h3>

<p>“No man has done more than the facetious Judge Haliburton, through the mouth of the
inimitable ‘Sam,’ to make the old parent country recognise and appreciate her queer
transatlantic progeny. His present collection of comic stories and laughable traits is a
budget of fun, full of rich specimens of American humour.”&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p>“Yankeeism, portrayed in its raciest aspect, constitutes the contents of these superlatively
entertaining sketches. The work embraces the most varied topics&mdash;political parties,
religious eccentricities, the flights of literature, and the absurdities of pretenders to learning,
all come in for their share of satire; while we have specimens of genuine American
exaggerations and graphic pictures of social and domestic life as it is. The work will
have a wide circulation.”&mdash;<i>John Bull.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE AMERICANS AT HOME.</h3>

<p>“In this highly entertaining work we are treated to another cargo of capital stories
from the inexhaustible store of our Yankee friend. In the volume before us he dishes up,
with his accustomed humour and terseness of style, a vast number of tales, none more
entertaining than another, and all of them graphically illustrative of the ways and manners
of brother Jonathan. The anomalies of American law, the extraordinary adventures
incident to life in the backwoods, and, above all, the peculiarities of American society, are
variously, powerfully, and, for the most part, amusingly exemplified.”&mdash;<i>John Bull.</i></p>

<p>“In the picturesque delineation of character, and the felicitous portraiture of national
features, no writer equals Judge Haliburton, and the subjects embraced in the present
delightful book call forth, in new and vigorous exercise, his peculiar powers. ‘The
Americans at Home’ will not be less popular than any of his previous works.”&mdash;<i>Post.</i></p>

<h3>JOHN HALIFAX, GENTLEMAN.</h3>

<p>“This is a very good and a very interesting work. It is designed to trace the career
from boyhood to age of a perfect man&mdash;a Christian gentleman, and it abounds in incident
both well and highly wrought. Throughout it is conceived in a high spirit, and written
with great ability. This cheap and handsome new edition is worthy to pass freely from
hand to hand as a gift-book in many households.”&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“The story is very interesting. The attachment between John Halifax and his wife is
beautifully painted, as are the pictures of their domestic life, and the growing up of their
children, and the conclusion of the book is beautiful and touching.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“The new and cheaper edition of this interesting work will doubtless meet with great
success. John Halifax, the hero of this most beautiful story, is no ordinary hero, and this
his history is no ordinary book. It is a full-length portrait of a true gentleman, one of
nature’s own nobility. It is also the history of a home, and a thoroughly English one.
The work abounds in incident, and is full of graphic power and true pathos. It is a book
that few will read without becoming wiser and better.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>A WOMAN’S THOUGHTS ABOUT WOMEN.</h3>

<p>“A book of sound counsel. It is one of the most sensible works of its kind, well written,
true-hearted, and altogether practical. Whoever wishes to give advice to a young lady
may thank the author for means of doing so.”&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“These thoughts are worthy of the earnest and enlightened mind, the all-embracing
charity, and the well-earned reputation of the author of ‘John Halifax.’”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>“This excellent book is characterised by good sense, good taste, and feeling, and is
written in an earnest, philanthropic, as well as practical spirit.”&mdash;<i>Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>A LIFE FOR A LIFE.</h3>

<p>“We are always glad to welcome this author. She writes from her own convictions,
and she has the power not only to conceive clearly what it is that she wishes to say, but
to express it in language effective and vigorous. In ‘A Life for a Life’ she is fortunate
in a good subject, and she has produced a work of strong effect. The reader, having read
the book through for the story, will be apt (if he be of our persuasion) to return and read
again many pages and passages with greater pleasure than on a first perusal. The whole
book is replete with a graceful, tender delicacy; and, in addition to its other merits, it is
written in good careful English.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>NOTHING NEW.</h3>

<p>“‘Nothing New’ displays all those superior merits which have made ‘John Halifax’
one of the most popular works of the day.”&mdash;<i>Post.</i></p>

<p>“The reader will find these narratives calculated to remind him of that truth and
energy of human portraiture, that spell over human affections and emotions, which have
stamped this author as one of the first novelists of our day.”&mdash;<i>John Bull.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE WOMAN’S KINGDOM.</h3>

<p>“‘The Woman’s Kingdom’ sustains the author’s reputation as a writer of the purest
and noblest kind of domestic stories. The novelist’s lesson is given with admirable force
and sweetness.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“‘The Woman’s Kingdom’ is remarkable for its romantic interest. The characters
are masterpieces. Edna is worthy of the hand that drew John Halifax.”&mdash;<i>Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>STUDIES FROM LIFE.</h3>

<p>“These studies are truthful and vivid pictures of life, often earnest, always full of right
feeling, and occasionally lightened by touches of quiet genial humour. The volume is remarkable
for thought, sound sense, shrewd observation, and kind and sympathetic feeling
for all things good and beautiful.”&mdash;<i>Post.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>CHRISTIAN’S MISTAKE.</h3>

<p>“A more charming story, to our taste, has rarely been written. Within the compass
of a single volume the writer has hit off a circle of varied characters, all true to nature&mdash;some
true to the highest nature&mdash;and she has entangled them in a story which keeps us
in suspense till the knot is happily and gracefully resolved; while, at the same time, a
pathetic interest is sustained by an art of which it would be difficult to analyse the secret.
It is a choice gift to be able thus to render human nature so truly, to penetrate its depths
with such a searching sagacity, and to illuminate them with a radiance so eminently the
writer’s own. Even if tried by the standard of the Archbishop of York, we should expect
that even he would pronounce ‘Christian’s Mistake’ a novel without a fault.”&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>“This is a story good to have from the circulating library, but better to have from one’s
bookseller, for it deserves a place in that little collection of clever and wholesome stories
which forms one of the comforts of a well-appointed home.”&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>MISTRESS AND MAID.</h3>

<p>“A good, wholesome book, as pleasant to read as it is instructive.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“This book is written with the same true-hearted earnestness as ‘John Halifax.’ The
spirit of the whole work is excellent.”&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“A charming tale charmingly told.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>A NOBLE LIFE.</h3>

<p>“This is one of those pleasant tales in which the author of ‘John Halifax’ speaks out
of a generous heart the purest truths of life.”&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“Few men, and no women, will read ‘A Noble Life’ without finding themselves the
better.”&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“A story of powerful and pathetic interest.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>A BRAVE LADY.</h3>

<p>“A very good novel, showing a tender sympathy with human nature, and permeated
by a pure and noble spirit.”&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p>“A most charming story.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>

<p>“We earnestly recommend this novel. It is a special and worthy specimen of the
author’s remarkable powers. The reader’s attention never for a moment flags.”&mdash;<i>Post.</i></p>

<h3>HANNAH.</h3>

<p>“A powerful novel of social and domestic life. One of the most successful efforts of a
successful novelist.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“A very pleasant, healthy story, well and artistically told. The book is sure of a wide
circle of readers. The character of Hannah is one of rare beauty.”&mdash;<i>Standard.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE UNKIND WORD.</h3>

<p>“The author of ‘John Halifax’ has written many fascinating stories, but we can call to
mind nothing from her pen that has a more enduring charm than the graceful sketches in
this work. Such a character as Jessie stands out from a crowd of heroines as the type of
all that is truly noble, pure, and womanly.”&mdash;<i>United Service Magazine.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>YOUNG MRS. JARDINE.</h3>

<p>“‘Young Mrs. Jardine’ is a pretty story, written in pure English.”&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p>“There is much good feeling in this book. It is pleasant and wholesome.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“A book that all should read. Whilst it is quite the equal of any of its predecessors
in elevation of thought and style, it is perhaps their superior in interest of plot and
dramatic intensity. The characters are admirably delineated, and the dialogue is natural
and clear.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i>

<h3>ADAM GRAEME OF MOSSGRAY.</h3>

<p>“‘Adam Graeme’ is a story awakening genuine emotions of interest and delight by its
admirable pictures of Scottish life and scenery. The plot is cleverly complicated, and
there is great vitality in the dialogue, and remarkable brilliancy in the descriptive passages,
as who that has read ‘Margaret Maitland’ would not be prepared to expect?
But the story has a ‘mightier magnet still,’ in the healthy tone which pervades it, in its
feminine delicacy of thought and diction, and in the truly womanly tenderness of its
sentiments. The eloquent author sets before us the essential attributes of Christian
virtue, their deep and silent workings in the heart, and their beautiful manifestations in
the life, with a delicacy, a power, and a truth which can hardly be surpassed.”&mdash;<i>Morning
Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE LAIRD OF NORLAW.</h3>

<p>“We have had frequent opportunities of commending Messrs. Hurst and Blackett’s
Standard Library. For neatness, elegance, and distinctness the volumes in this series
surpass anything with which we are familiar. ‘The Laird of Norlaw’ will fully sustain
the author’s high reputation. The reader is carried on from first to last with an energy
of sympathy that never flags.”&mdash;<i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>“‘The Laird of Norlaw’ is worthy of the author’s reputation. It is one of the most
exquisite of modern novels.”&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p>

<h3>IT WAS A LOVER AND HIS LASS.</h3>

<p>“In ‘It was a Lover and his Lass,’ we admire Mrs. Oliphant exceedingly. Her story is

one ancient Scottish spinster, who is nearly the counterpart of the admirable Mrs. Margaret
Maitland.”&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<h3>AGNES.</h3>

<p>“‘Agnes’ Is a novel superior to any of Mrs. Oliphant’s former works.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

always to be found high principle, good taste, sense, and refinement. ‘Agnes’ is a story
whose pathetic beauty will appeal irresistibly to all readers.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>A ROSE IN JUNE.</h3>

<p>“‘A Rose in June’ is as pretty as its title. The story is one of the best and most

<p>“A good book on a most interesting theme.”&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<h3>ALEC FORBES OF HOWGLEN.</h3>

<p>“No account of this story would give any idea of the profound interest that pervades
the work from the first page to the last.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“A novel of uncommon merit. Sir Walter Scott said he would advise no man to try
to read ‘Clarissa Harlowe’ out loud in company if he wished to keep his character for
manly superiority to tears. We fancy a good many hardened old novel-readers will feel
a rising in the throat as they follow the fortunes of Alec and Annie.”&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“The whole story is one of surpassing excellence and beauty.”&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“This book is full of good thought and good writing. Dr. Mac Donald looks in his stories
more to the souls of men and women than to their social outside. He reads life and
Nature like a true poet.”&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>ROBERT FALCONER.</h3>

<p>“‘Robert Falconer’ is a work brimful of life and humour and of the deepest human
interest. It is a work to be returned to again and again for the deep and searching
knowledge it evinces of human thoughts and feelings.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“This story abounds in exquisite specimens of the word-painting in which Dr. Mac
Donald excels, charming transcripts of Nature, full of light, air, and colour.”&mdash;<i>Saturday
Review.</i></p>

<p>“This noble story displays to the best advantage all the powers of Dr. Mac Donald’s
genius.”&mdash;<i>Illustrated London News.</i></p>

<p>“‘Robert Falconer’ is the noblest work of fiction that Dr. Mac Donald has yet produced.”&mdash;<i>British
Quarterly Review.</i></p>

to make them in themselves an intellectual treat to which the reader returns again and
again.”&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<h3>DAVID ELGINBROD.</h3>

<p>“A novel which is the work of a man of genius. It will attract the highest class of
readers.”&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>“There are many beautiful passages and descriptions in this book. The characters are
extremely well drawn.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“A clever novel. The incidents are exciting, and the interest is maintained to the
close. It may be doubted if Sir Walter Scott himself ever painted a Scotch fireside with
more truth than Dr. Mac Donald.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>“David Elginbrod is the finest character we have met in fiction for many a day. The
descriptions of natural scenery are vivid, truthful, and artistic; the general reflections are
those of a refined, thoughtful, and poetical philosopher, and the whole moral atmosphere
of the book is lofty, pure, and invigorating.”&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<h3>SIR GIBBIE.</h3>

<p>“‘Sir Gibbie’ is a book of genius.”&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

lifelike. There are many powerful scenes, and the portraits will stay long in our
memory.”&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p>“‘Sir Gibbie’ is unquestionably a book of genius. It abounds in humour, pathos,
insight into character, and happy touches of description.”&mdash;<i>Graphic.</i></p>

<p>“‘Sir Gibbie’ contains some of the most charming writing the author has yet produced.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“‘Sir Gibbie’ is one of the most touching and beautiful stories that has been written
for many years. It is not a novel to be idly read and laid aside; it is a grand work, to be
kept near at hand, and studied and thought over.”&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

A game at cards introduced into France by Signor Justiniani,
Ambassador of Venice in 1674. The players are the dealer or
banker, his assistant, who looks after the losing cards&mdash;a <i>croupier</i>,
in fact&mdash;and the punters, or anyone who plays against the banker.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">10</a>
To understand the numerous allusions to the game of cards called
Quadrill, it is necessary that the principles of the game should be given.
It was played by four persons, each having ten cards dealt to them.
</p>
<p>
The general laws of this game are, 1. It is not permitted to deal
the cards otherwise than four by three, the dealer being at liberty to
begin with which of those numbers he pleases. 2. If he who plays
either <i>sans prendre</i>, or calling a king, names a trump of a different
suit from that his game is in, or names two several suits, that which
he first named must be the trump. 3. He who plays must name the
trump by its proper name, as he likewise must the king he calls. 4.
He who has said ‘I pass,’ must not be again admitted to play, except
he plays by force, upon account of his having Spadille. 5. He who
has asked the question, and has leave given him to play, is obliged to
do it: but he must not play <i>sans prendre</i> except he is forced to do it.
6. He who has the four kings may call the queen of either of his
kings. 7. Neither the king nor queen of the suit which is trumps
must be called. 8. He who has one or several kings may call any king
he has in his hand; in such case, if he wins, he alone must make six
tricks; if he wins, it is all his own, and if he loses, he pays all by
himself. 9. Everyone ought to play in his turn, but for having done
otherwise, no one must be beasted. 10. He, however, whose turn is
not to play, having in his hand the king the ombre has called, and who
shall tramp about with either spadille, manille, or basto, or shall even
play down the king that was called, to give notice of his being the
friend, must not pretend to undertake the vole; nay, he must be condemned
to be beasted if it appears that he did it with any fraudulent
design. 11. He who has drawn a card from his game, and presented
it openly in order to play it, is obliged so to do, if his retaining it may
be either prejudicial to his game, or give any information to his friend,
especially if the card is a matadore; but he who plays <i>sans prendre</i>, or
calls upon his own king, is not subject to this law. 12. None ought to
look upon the tricks, nor to count aloud what has been played, except
when it is his turn to play, but to let everyone reckon for himself.
13. He who, instead of turning up the tricks before any one of his
players, shall turn up and discover his game, must be equally beasted
with him whose cards he has so discovered, the one paying one half, and
the other the like. 14. He who renounces must be beasted, as many
times as he has so done, but, if the cards are mixed, he is to pay but
one beast. 15. If the renounce prejudices the game, and the deal is
not played out, everyone may take up his cards, beginning at the trick
where the renounce was made, and play them over again. 16. He
who shows the game before the deal is out must be beasted, except
he plays <i>sans prendre</i>. 17. None of the three matadores can be commanded
down by an inferior trump. 18. If he who plays <i>sans prendre</i>
with the matadores in his hand, demands only one of them, he must
receive only that he mentioned. 19. He who, instead of <i>sans prendre</i>,
shall demand matadores, not having them, or he who shall demand <i>sans
prendre</i> instead of matadores, cannot compel the players to pay him
what is really his due. 20. Matadores are only paid when they are in
the hands of the ombre, or of the king his ally, whether all in one hand,
or separately in both. 21. He who undertakes the vole, and does not
make it, must pay as much as he would have received had he won it.
22. He who plays and does not make three tricks is to be beasted
alone, and must pay all that is to be paid; and, if he makes no tricks
at all, he must also pay to his two adversaries the vole, but not to his
friend.’&mdash;<i>The Oxford Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, 1828.</p></div>

Edward Philips or Phillips, in his life of Milton, attached to
‘Letters of State, written by Mr. John Milton,’ &amp;c., London,
1694, (p. 43), says: ‘He is said to have dyed worth &pound;1,500 in
Money (a considerable Estate, all things considered), besides
Household Goods; for he sustained such losses as might well have
broke any person less frugal and temperate than himself; no less
than &pound;2,000 which he had put for Security and Improvement into
the Excise Office, but, neglecting to recal it in time, could never
after get it out, with all the Power and Interest he had in the
Great ones of those Times; besides another great Sum by mismanagement
and for want of good advice.’</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">21</a>
Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol, thus writes in his life of
Milton, prefixed to his edition of ‘Paradise Lost,’ London, 1749:
‘His body was decently interred near that of his father (who had
died very aged about the year 1647) in the chancel of the church
of St. Giles, Cripplegate; and all his great and learned friends
in London, not without a friendly concourse of the common
people, paid their last respects in attending it to the grave. Mr.
Fenton, in his short but elegant account of the life of Milton,
speaking of our author’s having no monument, says that “he
desired a friend to inquire at St. Giles’s Church, where the sexton
showed him a small monument, which he said was supposed to be
Milton’s; but the inscription had never been legible since he was
employed in that office, which he has possessed about forty years.
This sure could never have happened in so short a space of time,
unless the epitaph had been industriously erased; and that supposition,
says Mr. Fenton, carries with it so much inhumanity
that I think we ought to believe it was not erected to his memory.”
It is evident that it was not erected to his memory, and that the
sexton was mistaken. For Mr. Toland, in his account of the life
of Milton, says that he was buried in the chancel of St. Giles’s
Church, “where the piety of his admirers will shortly erect a
monument becoming his worth, and the encouragement of letters
in King William’s reign.” This plainly implies that no monument
was erected to him at that time, and this was written in 1698,
and Mr. Fenton’s account was first published, I think, in 1725;
so that not above twenty-seven years intervened from the one
account to the other; and consequently the sexton, who it is said
was possessed of his office about forty years, must have been mistaken,
and the monument must have been designed for some other
person, and not for Milton.’</p></div>

Between the creditable trades of pawnbroker and dram-seller
there is a strict alliance. As Hogarth observes, the money lent
by Mr. Gripe is immediately conveyed to the shop of Mr. Killman,
who, in return for the produce of rags, distributes poison
under the specious name of cordials. See Hogarth’s celebrated
print called Gin Lane.</p></div>

Some idea of the duelling that went on in Ireland in the
latter part of last century may be gathered from the following
extract from Sir Jonah’s book (vol. ii, p. 3): ‘I think I may
challenge any country in Europe to show such an assemblage of
gallant <i>judicial</i> and <i>official</i> antagonists at fire and sword as is
exhibited even in the following list:
</p>
<p>
The Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Earl Clare, fought the
Master of the Rolls, Curran.
</p>
<p>
The Chief Justice, K.B. Lord Clonmell, fought Lord Tyrawley
(a privy counsellor), Lord Llandaff, and two others.
</p>
<p>
The judge of the county of Dublin, Egan, fought the Master
of the Rolls, Roger Barrett, and three others.
</p>
<p>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Right Hon. Isaac Corry,
fought the Right Hon. Henry Grattan (a privy counsellor), and
another.
</p>
<p>
A Baron of the Exchequer, Baron Medge, fought his brother-in-law
and two others.
</p>
<p>
The Chief Justice, C. P. Lord Norbury, fought Fire-eater
Fitzgerald and two other gentlemen, and frightened Napper
Tandy, and several besides: one hit only.
</p>
<p>
The judge of the Prerogative Court, Dr. Dingenan, fought
one barrister and frightened another on the ground. N.B.&mdash;The
latter case a curious one.
</p>
<p>
The Chief Counsel to the Revenue, Henry Deane Grady,
fought Counsellor O’Mahon, Counsellor Campbell, and others:
all hits.
</p>
<p>
The Master of the Rolls fought Lord Buckinghamshire, the
Chief Secretary, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The provost of the University of Dublin, the Right Hon.
Hely Hutchinson, fought Mr. Doyle, Master in Chancery, and
some others.
</p>
<p>
The Chief Justice C. P. Patterson, fought three country
gentlemen, one of them with swords, another with guns, and
wounded all of them.
</p>
<p>
The Right Hon. George Ogle (a privy counsellor) fought
Barney Coyle, a distiller, because he was a Papist. They fired
eight shots, and no hit; but the second broke his own arm.
</p>
<p>
Thomas Wallace, K.C., fought Mr. O’Gorman, the Catholic
Secretary.
</p>
<p>
Counsellor O’Connell fought the Orange chieftain; fatal to
the champion of Protestant ascendency.
</p>
<p>
The collector of the customs of Dublin, the Hon. Francis
Hutchinson, fought the Right Hon. Lord Mountmorris.
</p>
<p>
Two hundred and twenty-seven memorable and official duels
have actually been fought during my grand climacteric.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
